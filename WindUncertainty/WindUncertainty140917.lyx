Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report documents how measurements of wind are made from the NSF/NCAR
 Gulfstream V research aircraft (hereafter, GV) and provides a characterization
 of the uncertainty associated with those measurements.
 The characterization applies to the system as it existed in 2014, in particular
 as it operated in the DEEPWAVE research project flown from New Zealand
 in June-July 2014.
 Key aspects influencing the uncertainty in the measurements as characterized
 here are the presence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

OmniSTAR
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 GPS measurements, providing measurements of the velocity of the aircraft
 relative to the earth, a calibration of airspeed provided by the Laser
 Air Motion Sensor (Cooper et al., 2014), and a newly developed all-weather
 wind sensor or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gust pod
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 employing a Rosemount 858 probe mounted under the wing of the GV.
 These complemented the standard wind-sensing system comprised of a Honeywell
 XXX inertial reference unit, normal GPS measurements, and a gust-sensing
 system based on pressure ports in the nose radome.
 The results obtained here do not necessarily apply to measurements from
 earlier projects when not all these components were available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 describes the components of the wind-measuring system in more detail, and
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Calibrations"

\end_inset

 summarizes how the measurements have been calibrated, tested, and intercompared.
 Some related studies affecting the measurements are then presented in the
 next sections.
 This information all provides the basis for Section
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Uncertainty-components"

\end_inset

, where the contributions to uncertainty from various sources are tabulabed
 and where there is a discussion of the basis for each estimate contributing
 to uncertainty in the measured wind.
 This report then concludes with a summary characterizing the overall uncertaint
y and the separate systematic and random components included in that uncertainty.

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three wind-sensing systems are described in this document: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

standard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 wind sensing system that uses pressure ports on the radome combined with
 airspeed measured using a pitot tube and ground-speed measured by an inertial
 reference unit and a global positioning system (GPS) receiver.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A gust-pod system consisting of a Rosemount 858 airflow sensor mounted under
 the wing combined with an inertial system co-located with the airflow sensor
 and linked to GPS measurements via a Kalman filter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A laser air motion sensor described by Spuler (2010?XXX) combined with another
 IRU/GPS system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the measurement components differ, for each of these the measurement
 of wind involves the vector sum of two components, the motion of the air
 relative to the aircraft and the motion of the aircraft relative to the
 Earth.
 The former is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relative wind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and is measured as a three-component vector having magnitude equal to the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true airspeed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and angles relative to the aircraft reference frame characterized by the
 angle of attack and the sideslip angle.
 The angle of attack is considered positive if the relative wind is from
 below the aircraft, and the sideslip angle is considered positive if the
 relative wind is from the starboard side of the aircraft.
 The relative wind defined in the coordinate system of the aircraft (conventiona
lly with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 forward, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 in the starboard direction, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 obtained from the cross product 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x^{\prime}}\times\hat{y^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 and so approximately downward but oriented to align with the aircraft reference
 frame) must be transformed to an Earth-based reference system (conventionally
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}$
\end_inset

 toward east, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 toward north, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}$
\end_inset

 upward) so that the components can be combined to yield the Earth-relative
 wind.
 This transformation is a function of the attitude angles of the aircraft,
 heading (
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

), pitch (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

), and roll (
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

), measured by an inertial reference unit in all three cases discussed here.
 Once in an Earth-based reference system, the relative wind vector is added
 to the vector representing the aircraft motion relative to the Earth to
 obtain the wind.
 The sources of the various measurements entering this processing sequence
 vary among the three systems and will be discussed separately below for
 each system.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Relative Wind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the standard aircraft coordinate system with 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 forward, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 starboard, and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 downward, the three corresponding components of the relative wind 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{v}$
\end_inset

 (cf.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Lenschow, 1986) are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{v=}\begin{pmatrix}u_{r}\\
v_{r}\\
w_{r}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}V^{*}\\
V^{*}\thinspace\tan\beta\\
V^{*}\thinspace\tan\alpha
\end{pmatrix}\label{eq:relative wind}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where, if 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is the true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}=$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $V/\sqrt{1+\tan^{2}\alpha+\tan^{2}\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the component of true airspeed along the aircraft longitudinal (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

) axis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the angle of attack and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 the sideslip angle.
 The sign convention is such that the relative wind is positive when 
\emph on
from 
\emph default
the direction of the axis for each component.
 (The magnitude of 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{v}$
\end_inset


\series default
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 as required.) The relative wind is therefore determined from measurements
 of true airspeed, angle of attack, and sideslip angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Transformation to an Earth Reference Frame
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orientations of the aircraft, the gust pod, and the LAMS are measured
 by IRUs located respectively in the fuselage and in the pod itself.
 Each measures heading, pitch, and roll.
 There are again two alternate paths that can be followed: Transform to
 the aircraft reference frame and use the standard software (gusto.c), or
 transform to an Earth reference frame directly and use the gust-pod ground
 speeds to obtain the wind.
 The former takes advantage of the higher-quality IRU in the cabin, but
 involves additional complications arising from contributions of angular
 velocity of the aircraft and mis-alignment between the inertial systems.
 The latter course will be followed here, but it may be worth exploring
 if the former might give higher-quality measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The required transformation is described by three rotation matrices, defined
 in Bulletin 23 Eqs.
 2.5 and 2.6:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \cos\phi & -\sin\phi\\
0 & \sin\phi & \cos\phi
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos\theta & 0 & \sin\theta\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
-\sin\theta & 0 & \cos\theta
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{3}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos\psi & -\sin\psi & 0\\
\sin\psi & \cos\psi & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where {
\begin_inset Formula $\phi,\,\theta,\,\psi$
\end_inset

} are {roll, pitch, heading}.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transformation needs to be in the following order to conform to conventional
 definitions of the attitude angles: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotate by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

 using the roll angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 (ROLL or CROLL_GP) to level the wings by a rotation about the x axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotate by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

 using the pitch angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 (PITCH or CPITCH_GP) to level the aircraft by a rotation about the y axis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rotate by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{3}$
\end_inset

 using the heading angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 (THDG or CTHDG_GP) to obtain components in a true-north reference frame.
 At this point, the relative-wind vector in an Earth-reference coordinate
 system is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{r}=T_{3}(T_{2}(T_{1}\mathbf{v}))$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is given by (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:relative wind"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measured ground-speeds of the gust pod then can be added to the relative
 wind to get the true Earth-relative wind.
 In the

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The radome-based system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary measurement on the GV is that based on measurement of true airspeed
 via a pitot tube, airflow angles via pressure differences measured on the
 nose radome, attitude angles measured by an inertial reference unit, and
 ground-speed components measured by the same inertial reference unit and
 also by a Global Positioning System receiver.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ambient and dynamic pressure
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sub:Dynamic-pressure"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ambient or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

static
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pressure is measured on the GV at pressure ports called static buttons
 that are located at positions on the fuselage where in normal flight the
 pressure is approximately the pressure present outside the airflow disturbance
 produced by the aircraft.
 Because there are residual effects of airflow that change with angle of
 attack and Mach number, corrections are applied to these measurements to
 obtain better representation of the true ambient pressure.
 The dynamic pressure is the pressure that develops if air is compressed
 and adiabatically brought to rest relative to the aircraft.
 This is sensed using a pitot tube, a tube pointed in the direction of the
 relative airflow and specially designed to be relatively insensitive to
 small-angle changes in the direction of the relative airflow.
 The excess pressure above the ambient is equal to 0.5 times the air density
 times the airspeed squared, so this excess pressure can be used to determine
 the airspeed of the aircraft.
 On NSF/NCAR aircraft, the measurement of dynamic pressure is made by combining
 a measurement of static pressure with a measurement of the difference between
 static pressure (at the static buttons) and dynamic pressure (at a pitot
 tube).
 The latter difference is measured by a Honeywell digital transducer, Honeywell
 PPT0005GXX2VB-S021.
 Because any errors affecting the measurement of static pressure also affect
 the difference between dynamic and static pressure, the same corrections
 that are applied to static pressure (for errors in the pressure delivered
 by the static ports) are also applied to the measured difference between
 static and dynamic pressure.
 The correction that is applied is based on comparison to measurements from
 a Laser Air Motion Sensor, as discussed in detail by Cooper et al., 2014.
 That reference also has additional information on the location of the sensors
 and the corrections applied to the sensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristics of the differential transducer are as follows: range
 0-5 PSI or approximately 0-345 hPa, standard uncertainty 0.001 PSI or approximat
ely 0.07 hPa, response time 0.05s.
 The absolute transducer used to measure static pressure is a Paroscientific
 Digiquartz Series 1000 transducer, which has a standard uncertainty of
 0.1 hPa.
 Cooper et al., 2014, argue that the measurements of static and dynamic pressure,
 corrected for flow distortion or generation of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

static defect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the static-pressure ports, each have standard uncertainty of 0.3 hPa
 and precision (for straight and level flight) of 0.1 hPa.

\begin_layout Standard
The pressure ports are connected to differential pressure sensors, one between
 the top and bottom ports (variable ADIFR), one between the left and right
 ports (variable BDIFR), and one between the center port and the static
 source (variable QCR).
 The latter provides an alternative measurement of dynamic pressure but
 is not normally used.
 The measurements ADIFR and BDIFR are obtained from Honeywell PPT0001DXX2VB-S021
 differential transducers, with characteristics as follows: range: 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

1 PSI or approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

69 hPa, standard uncertainty 0.0005 PSI or approximately 0.03 hPa, and response
 time 0.05s.
 These are analog sensors and are calibrated at the Research Aviation Facility
 using a pressure cart with a traceable reference transducer, and the analog
 outputs are digitized by the aircraft data system for recording and translated
 from recorded voltage to pressure using the pressure-cart calibration.
 These measurements are then used with procedures discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:Calibrations"

\end_inset

 to find the angle of attack and sideslip angle of the relative wind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Ground-speed components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two sources of information regarding the ground-speed vector,
 an inertial reference unit (IRU) and a Global Positioning System (GPS).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\bar under
The IRU:
\bar default
 The inertial system is a Laseref IV P/N HD2001, built by Honeywell Aerospace.
 There are three units on the aircraft, two of which are recorded via the
 ARINC data bus to standard data files.
 These are strap-down ring laser gyro micro inertial systems.
 The measurements of ground-speed components are affected by errors that
 arise from initial alignment errors or orientation errors resulting from
 gyro responses to acceleration and so often exhibit a characteristic Shuler
 oscillation with magnitude that can be as much as 1--3 m/s.
 It is therefore important to remove these errors by comparison to measurements
 provided by the GPS that are not subject to the Schuler oscillation.
 In addition, there are signal delays that are accounted for in post processing
 to align measurements with other recorded data, and there are some inherent
 filters in the IRU computer that affect the signals transmitted to us.
 The orientation of this unit was defined and checked by initial survey
 to coincide with the aircraft reference axes.
 [XXX need specs here for velocity components]

 The primary GPS unit is a Novatel OEM-3 differential GPS unit (L1/L2) with
 OmniSTAR XP satellite update for (ionospheric) corrections.
 As used on the GV, it reports ground-speed components at a rate of 5 Hz,
 although faster rates are possible.
 The claimed standard uncertainty for position is 0.15

\begin_layout Standard
Attitude angles (roll, pitch, and heading) are provided by the IRU discussed

\begin_inset space ~

mrad.
 [XXX need specs] There are duplicate inertial systems, so a measure of
 uncertainty is how well they agree.
 For the period 3:00:00--6:00:00 on DEEPWAVE flight 15, the mean difference
 was 0.1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and the standard deviation in the difference between measurements was also
 about 0.12
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}\simeq2$

 then the standard deviation is only 0.017

\begin_layout Standard
An all-weather wind pod has been developed by Allen Schanot and is available
 for mounting under the wing of the GV, where it was installed during the
 2014 project DEEPWAVE.
 It will be called the gust-pod system here.
 It fits into a standard 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 canister and uses a Rosemount 858 probe, but the location under the wing
 is one where there is substantial flow distortion in comparison to the
 free stream so an unconventional calibration is needed to use the measurements.
 The 858 probe is heated and should be unaffected by icing or ice accumulation,
 so this system has the potential to provide wind measurements in cases
 where icing or other problems cause failure of the standard radome-based
 system.
 The five ports are oriented forward, upward and downward 45

 on the leading edge of the sensor, which has the shape of a hemisphere.
 There are also ports in a ring around the cylinder behind the hemisphere
 that provide a static source.
 The measurements are the pressure difference between the top and bottom
 ports (ADIFR_GP), the pressure difference between the right and left ports
 (BDIFR_GP), and the pressure difference between the forward port and the
 static ports (QC_GP).
 In addition, the pressure provided by the ring of static ports is recorded
 as PS_GP.
 The system incorporates a Systron-Donner CMIGITS IRU, which is mounted
 in the pod to be able to measure vibrations and wing-flex motions that
 will affect the measurements of wind.
 This provides measurements of attitude angles, ground-speed components,
 and accelerations and uses a GPS signal (from the same unit used for the
 radome-based system) in a Kalman-filter feedback loop to reduce errors
 in the measurements.

 This program, if run from within the html interface to RStudio on tikal

Figure

 shows the high-rate variance spectra from the two systems.
 There is a significant difference at frequencies above about 3 Hz, with
 the gust-pod distribution dropping faster but the standard wind WIC showing
 more variance.
 The high frequency spectrum from the gust pod may be more realistic; it
 is unusual to see high variance at these frequencies without a related
 generating source.
 These spectra were also studied for coherence, which was above 0.9 for frequenci
es less than 1 Hz but then fell to around 0.2 at 10 Hz.
 This is an indication that the two measurements are different in important
 ways at the high frequency.
 This would not be the case if they were responding with different amplitudes;
 the signals must really be mostly incoherent at the highest frequency.
 The separation wing-to-fuselage is about 7 m lateral and 13 m longitudinal,
 so that doesn't seem enough to cause the low high-frequency coherence.
 The phase changes from in-phase at frequencies less than 1 Hz to 180
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 out-of-phase at 9 Hz, with WIG lagging, so this is consistent with the
 longitudinal offset.
 Shifting WIG relative to WIC also gave maximum coherence if WIG were shifted
 forward 1/25 s.

\begin_layout Standard
With this shift, there does not appear to be any difference in phase between
 the two measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the gust pod does not yet perform well in turns.
 The reason is that the orientation of the gust-pod IRU is not perfectly
 along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, and as a result any roll of
 the aircraft introduces complex combinations of roll, heading, and pitch
 into the gust-pod IRU.
 It should be possible to remove these to some extent, although differences
 in alignment of the IRU from flight to flight may perturb these angles
 and make it difficult to get good measurements in turns.
 The circle maneuvers from the calibration flight should provide valuable
 information regarding the potential for improving the in-turn performance
 of the gust pod .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mixing of Attitude Angles for the Gust Pod
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One problem that arises with the gust pod is that the orientation is such
 that the attitude angles (pitch, roll, heading) are defined relative to
 the orientation of the inertial unit in the gust pod, which is not aligned
 with the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
 As a result, the roll introduced in turns, even if primarily a rotation
 about the aircraft longitudinal axis, will appear as a combination of attitude-
angle changes in the gust pod.
 Errors arising from the initial alignment at the start of flights will
 also cause problems with the measured attitude angles, and it is likely
 that these will be more significant near the start of flights because the
 build-in Kalman filter will us GPS measurements to correct such errors
 in the course of the flight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem with the reference frame for attitude angles will have two
 consequences: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Measurements from the gust pod in turns will likely have large errors in
 comparison to the errors in level flight.
 The measurements from the gust pod should probably be flagged as of poor
 quality whenever the roll exceeds some threshold like perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm5^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 (The measurements often look reasonable in turns despite this worry.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There may be an offset introduced by the mixing of sideslip and angle-of-attack,
 and this will affect the reference or average value of the measured vertical
 wind, sometimes introducing a significant offset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the weight of the aircraft decreases during the flight, so does
 the angle-of-attack, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:AOAGPrf18"

\end_inset

.
 Because the wing flexes, the measured sideslip also varies with time, as
 shown by Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SSGPrf18"

, so there will be an offset in sideslip that will affect the mean lateral
 component of the wind.

 In addition, the mean value of the measured roll was close to zero for
 the in-cabin IRU but about 1.375
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 for the gust-pod IRU.
 Coupling among these attitude angles appears to have caused the large offset
 in WIG at the start of this flight.
 Because the gust-pod IRU incorporates a Kalman filter that can use measured
 errors in position and ground speed as determined by comparison to a GPS
 measurement to refine the measurements, the large error appears to have
 been corrected as the flight progressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These effects suggest that the vertical wind measured by the gust pod may
 have an offset in some cases, particularly at the start of flights, and
 the sideslip can also have an offset that will contribute to the lateral
 component of the measured wind.
 These are weaknesses in the measurements from the gust pod that, at this
 stage, do not appear easily corrected.
 A future study implementing Schuler tuning in a post-processing step and
 correcting for the entwined-angle effects may be able to reduce these weaknesse
s, but that will require a more extensive research project than possible
 prior to processing of DEEPWAVE data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Next Steps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A procedure for processing the gust-pod measurements will be needed.
 It may be possible to use code in gusto.c for this purpose or otherwise
 to implement the process used here into nimbus, because this is being done
 second-by-second as needed for nimbus.
 Alternately, the code used here can run after nimbus processing to add
 the gust-pod variables.
 If this course is followed, the R script could be improved because I didn't
 vectorize the angle transformations yet, in the interest of getting it
 to work first.
 The software / data processing group will have to decide which is better,
 and it may be preferable to use different procedures for DEEPWAVE and for
 future use in order to produce the DEEPWAVE data quickly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As noted above, there are issues with the gust-pod measurements in turns
 that need to be addressed.
 These issues will affect the standard data also because in turbulence the
 roll changes and this may feed into the other measurements even at small
 roll angles.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The relative timing of the measurements entering the calculation of wind
 still needs to be addressed.
 The IRU information is transmitted for recording with some delay, and correctio
ns for those delays are in place.
 However, small errors in those delays can cause phase shifts among the
 measurements that, for example, result in residual perturbations of the
 vertical wind during pitch maneuvers.
 These should be tuned to minimize those perturbations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An additional worthwhile study will be to see if using GPS measurements
 to determine the Schuler oscillation can improve measurements of pitch
 and heading and so lead to improved wind measurements.
 There is some evidence of this problem in an apparent changing offset in
 the vertical wind, so any improvement here can be very useful to DEEPWAVE.

 DEEPWAVE Flight RF15 on 3 July 2014 was devoted to calibration maneuvers.
 Measurements from that flight, combined with similar calibration maneuvers
 flown on RF11 at 40,000 ft, are used to determine sensitivity coefficients
 for angle of attack (AKRD and AK_GP) and for sideslip (SSRD and SS_GP).
 A larger data set, described below, it also used to study the representativenes
s and uncertainty of the resulting sensitivity coefficients.
 This section also discusses the relative timing of the measurements.

w=V\sin(\alpha-\phi)+w_{p}\label{eq:VWind}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 the pitch, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$

 the vertical motion or rate-of-climb of the aircraft.
 The solution for the angle-of-attack is
\end_layout

\begin{equation}
\alpha^{*}=\phi-\arcsin\frac{w_{p}}{V}\label{eq:alphaWithwZero}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
can be used as a reference angle-of-attack to which to fit a parameterized
 formula.
 This fit reference depends on measurements of pitch, rate-of-climb, and
 true airspeed.
 Even in the presence of waves, fitting to this as functions of the radome
 measurements and other flight characteristics should average any real effects
 of vertical wind as long as the vertical wind over the flight segments
 used averages to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the radome, the relevant variables are 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

=PITCH, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}=$
\end_inset

GGVSPDB, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V=$
\end_inset

TASX.
 The radome measures the pressure difference (ADIFR) between top and bottom
 ports on the radome, and this pressure is usually normalized by some measure
 of dynamic pressure like QCF or QCXC or QCRC.
 The former is preferable because the use of corrected QCXC requires the
 application of static-defect corrections that themselves depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, leading to circularity in the calculation, and QCR and QCRC are sometimes
 affected by icing or freezing of accumulated water even when ADIFR continues
 to function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the gust pod, the relevant variables are 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

=CPITCH_GP, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

=CVSPD_GP, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

=TASX.
 The gust-pod measurements differ from those measured relative to the fuselage;
 for example, the pitch of the gust pod is several degrees different from
 that of the fuselage because of the way in which the gust-pod IRU is installed.
 However, the true airspeed 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:alphaWithwZero"

\end_inset

) is measured better by the fuselage system, so TASX will be used for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 The equation with the appropriate variables is then: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{*}=\mathrm{CPITCH\_GP}-\arcsin\frac{\mathrm{CVSPD\_GP}}{\mathrm{TASX}}\label{eq:AOAeq}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Calibration
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of the angle-of-attack (i.e., determining the sensitivity coefficients) then
 requires determining a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\{x_{i}\})$
\end_inset

 of measured quantities that matches 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{*}$
\end_inset

 determined from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AOAeq"

\end_inset

).
 Possible terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 in that function may include ADIFR and related measurements of pressure
 and dynamic pressure as well as Mach number, and powers and products of
 these terms.
 For the Rosemount 858 sensor used with the gust pod, it is expected from
 theory that one element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 will be ADIFR_GP/QC_GP.
 Wind tunnel and theoretical studies predict how the pressure will vary
 on a hemispheric surface with changing angles, but those don't necessarily
 apply to the mounting location on the GV because there is considerable
 flow distortion at the under-wing location of the pod and that affects
 the pressure response to changes in flow angles.
 Therefore, the best approach is to use the above approach for that sensor
 also and determine a functional response that matches the calibration data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Application to the radome
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best method for calibrating angle-of-attack is through the use of speed
 runs.
 In this maneuver, the aircraft is slowed to a speed near the lower range
 of its operating range, then accelerated to near the upper limit, and then
 slowed again to normal cruise.
 If this is done while flying a level track, the angle of attack will vary
 through its normal range and the pitch will vary similarly.
 If there is no vertical wind or if a fluctuating vertical wind averages
 to zero, (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:alphaWithwZero"

\end_inset

) then can be used to provide a reference angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{*}$
\end_inset

 that serves as reference for the parameterized fit.
 There were three speed runs during RF15, at the times 3:21--3:29, 4:15--4:23,
 and 5:01--5:11 UTC.
 On RF11, there was a similar speed run flown from 10:30--10:40.
 For the purpose of this calibration of angle-of-attack, only those periods
 were used.
 In addition, because some of the measurements at minimum speed deviated
 from the otherwise simple fits, only measurements with true airspeed in
 excess of 130 m/s were used; this eliminated some of the slowest parts
 of the speed runs, but that is a flight speed not used in normal operation.

\begin_layout Standard
The sensitivity to the pressure difference between vertically separated
 ports is the most important part of the calibration of angle of attack.
 Secondary terms are sometimes needed to adjust the value to maintain a
 correct zero.
 Therefore, the fit was done in two parts.
 First, the four speed runs alone were used to determine the sensitivity
 to the pressure ratio, and then a larger dataset was used to incorporate
 a wider range of flight conditions.
 The first fit was to the following simplified equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{*}=c_{0}^{*}+c_{1}^{*}\frac{\Delta p_{\alpha}}{q}\label{eq:AOAsens1term}

, the thin grey line under the thick orange dashed line represents the uncertain
ty in the fit result and shows that the uncertainty in representing these
 data with this set of coefficients is negligible.
 The more significant uncertainty, however, comes from the assumption that
 the vertical wind is zero for these periods of the speed runs.
 Therefore, additional studies will be used below for further evaluation
 of the uncertainty introduced by this assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous studies of the radome where low-altitude flight segments were included
 indicated that an additional term was needed in the calibration to adjust
 the zero for vertical wind for flight in the boundary layer over the ocean.
 The standard calibration determined in that way is that given in the RAF
 document on Processing Algorithms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha=c_{0}^{\prime}+\frac{\Delta p_{\alpha}}{q}(c_{1}^{\prime}+c_{2}^{\prime}M\label{eq:AOAstandard}

\end_inset

with coefficients {
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\prime}$
\end_inset

} = {4.604, 18.67, 6.49}.
 The last term provided some adjustment dependent on Mach number and help
 avoid an offset in vertical wind at low airspeed.

 would represent the angle-of-attack in conditions with vertical wind.
 For example, including "PITCH" as a term in the fit resulted in a coefficient
 for this term of about 0.4, and such a large correlation between resulting
 measurements of angle-of-attack and pitch would bias the response to a
 true vertical wind.

so the coefficients are tightly constrained by the fit.
 Surprisingly, the correlation between error terms was very high and positive,
 increasing the combined effects of these errors in any calculation of angle-of-
attack.
 The larger dataset provided results consistent with those from the speed
 runs alone but contained 17,721 measurements vs.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

only 2,019 for the speed-run dataset, so the larger set provides an opportunity
 to examine the consistency of results from subsets of the measurements.
 For this purpose, randomly selected but exclusive subsets of the data were
 selected repeatedly and the fit coefficients were determined from each
 of these subsets.
 In one example, the dataset was divided randomly into 100 subsets and the
 fit coefficients calculated for each of those subsets, and then this process
 was repeated 50 times.
 The result was mean coefficients of 4.4611
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

0.0699 and 21.4740
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

0.8834.
 Repeating this for different subset sizes 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 indicated that the standard deviations in the coefficients scaled in a
 manner consistent with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{N}$
\end_inset

 behavior, suggesting that the results are not biased by isolated outlier
 measurements such as would occur from regions with true vertical wind.
 The subsetting also revealed that the individual coefficients were highly
 correlated, with correlation coefficient 0.99.
 The effect of this is the two error terms add almost linearly, not in quadratur
e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of these errors on the resulting angle of attack, for this dataset,
 was evaluated by applying randomly generated Gaussian fluctuations to the
 coefficients and calculating the net effect on the parameterized representation.
 The resulting standard error in angle-of-attack was 0.001
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 However, because the speed-run values and standard values gave deviations
 relative to this calibration of about 0.03
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, that may be a better estimate of the uncertainty in angle of attack from
 possible bias, with the smaller standard error representing the random
 component of that uncertainty.
 The net effect on vertical wind produced by this uncertainty in the sensitivity
 coefficients for angle-of-attack is therefore estimated to be about 0.1

 remained as determined from the pitot tube and static ports of the main

 involving more terms was needed to represent the reference measurements

\begin_layout Subsection
Sideslip Angle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Equations underlying the calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calibration of the sideslip angle is more difficult, both because the equations
 are more complicated and because the maneuver is very hard to fly.
 Ideally, the sideslip maneuver should only change yaw angle and heading
 without change in roll, altitude, or angle-of-attack, but that is impossible
 to fly.
 It is practical, however, to minimize roll and change in altitude, and
 that was how these maneuvers were flown.
 The three sets of yaw maneuvers were at these times: 3:32:00--3:35:30,
 4:31:00--4:33:30, and 5:26:40--5:29:30 UTC.
 Because the yaw maneuvers on rf11 (10:25:00 to 10:30:00) were flown in
 the old way, they were not combined with these new measurements, but it
 does not appear that the sideslip calibration has any significant dependence
 on altitude.
 In the case of yaw maneuvers, the calibration is based on the expectation
 that the horizontal wind remains constant.
 The first-order equations for the east and north components of the wind,
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
u & = & -U_{a}\sin(\Psi+\beta)+u_{p}\nonumber \\
v & = & -U_{a}\cos(\Psi+\beta)+v_{p}\label{eq:horizWindeqs}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 the heading, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 the sideslip angle, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{p}$
\end_inset

 are the eastward and northward ground-speed components of the aircraft.
 These two equations lead to the following reference formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta^{*}=-\Psi+\arctan\left(\frac{u_{p}-u}{v_{p}-v}\right)\label{eq:beta-equation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the second term represents a correction for the change in direction
 of motion of the aircraft, which is difficult to avoid in the yaw maneuver.
 The measurements thus provide 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$
\end_inset

, an estimate of the sideslip during the yaw maneuvers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is, however, a circular component in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta-equation"

\end_inset

) because it involves the wind components and those require 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for their measurement when sideslip changes.
 To reduce the feedback from this term, the horizontal wind components 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 were low-pass-filtered with periods ranging from 5--60 s and the filtered
 values were used in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta-equation"

\end_inset

).
 Filtering made small differences in the fit coefficients but increased
 the residual error significantly, but 60-s filtering was still selected
 because that is a period long in comparison to the yaw maneuvers so it
 should reduce possible bias in the fit coefficients from use of the older
 sensitivity coefficients and any associated fluctuations in the wind measuremen
ts during maneuvers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Application to the radome-based and gust-pod systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For both systems, a relatively simple fit was sufficient, in the following
 form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta=e_{0}+e_{1}\frac{\Delta p_{\beta}}{q}\label{eq:betaFunctionForm}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the pressure difference between horizontally separated pressure ports
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 the dynamic pressure.
 For the radome, 
\begin_inset Formula $q=$
\end_inset

QCF and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p_{\beta}=$
\end_inset

BDIFR; for the gust-pod, 
\begin_inset Formula $q=$
\end_inset

QC_GP and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p_{\beta}=$
\end_inset

BDIFR_GP.
 The result for the radome was coefficients {e} = {0.016, 21.9915}, squared
 correlation 0.94 and residual standard error 0.19, as listed below.
 The plotted measurements and this fit are shown in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:sideslip"

\end_inset

.
 (The first coefficient being near zero is a forced result from using calculated
 wind components in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta-equation"

\end_inset

); the sideslip offset that is represented by this term will be determined
 later by other means.) The scatter in this plot was much less without filtering
 or with less filtering of the wind components; the residual standard error
 for that case was 0.096, the squared correlation increased to 0.98, and the
 coefficients changed to {
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
ensuremath{-0.0027}
\end_layout

\end_inset

, 20.8005}.
 The change in coefficients is minor and the plots would look much better
 than the following plots, but it seems appropriate to apply the filtering
 so for now those results will be adopted for further use.

On additional study is needed to determine the sensitivity coefficients
 for sideslip.
 An offset in sideslip, arising from an erroneous first coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$
\end_inset

 in the calibration, would produce an offset in the lateral component of
 the measured wind, and that erroneous lateral component would enter the
 calibration equation to again give a first coefficient near zero.
 An offset therefore must be determined in another way.
 Two candidates for finding the offset are reverse-heading maneuvers, during
 which the horizontal wind component lateral to the aircraft should remain
 constant but change sign, or circle maneuvers, during which an offset in
 sideslip will appear as a sinusoidally varying perturbation to the wind.
 Here a set of circles, flown with constant roll, will be used.
 Such circles produce a pattern that drifts with the wind, and that drift
 as measured by GPS provides an independent reference for the average horizontal
 wind.

%

subsection*{The Components of the Relative Wind}% % The gust pod is a new
 wind-sensing system so it is useful to document how the measurements are
 handled.
 The probe itself has five pressure-sensing holes located on a hemispheric
 cap pointed into the wind.
 The pressure difference between the two ports located upward and downward
 from centerline, measured as ADIFR
\backslash
_GP, is used in the calculation of angle-of-attack.
 The similar pressure difference between the two ports located toward starboard
 and toward port of centerline, measured as BDIFR
\backslash
_GP, are used in the calculation of sideslip.
 In addition, the probe has static ports located on the side of the cylinder
 carrying the hemispheric cap, and the difference between the pressure at
 the forward port and that at the static ports is measured as the dynamic
 pressure QC
\backslash
_GP.
 The static pressure is also measured, as PS
\backslash
_GP.% % In addition, there is an inertial reference unit mounted with the
 gust pod to measure its attitude angles (roll, pitch, heading) and to measure
 the three components of motion of the aircraft relative to the Earth.
 This unit receives GPS information and uses it to update its measurements
 via a Kalman filter.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurements ADIFR_GP and BDIFR_GP, normalized by QC_GP, are used with
 the calibrations in the preceding section to find the angle-of-attack and
 sideslip.
 In addition, to find the relative wind, a measurement of true airspeed
 (TAS) is needed.
 In an effort to allow the gust-pod system to operate independently of the
 standard radome-based system, it is desirable to determine the true airspeed
 directly from the gust-pod measurements.
 However, the standard system has been calibrated to low uncertainty by
 reference to the Laser Air Motion Sensor, so for the purpose of calibration
 that true airspeed (TASX) will be used as a reference.
 Once the gust-pod measurement of true airspeed is calibrated, the gust-pod
 system still measures wind without future reference to the standard system,
 but the calibration process links the two systems to have a common reference
 for TAS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, the next step needed to use the gust pod wind-sensing system
 is to determine a functional relationship between gust-pod measurements
 and the true airspeed.
 The approach taken is to fit the basic pressure ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $q/p$
\end_inset

 as measured by the 858 probe to match the corresponding pressure ratio
 provided by the conventional measurements of dynamic and static pressure.
 The relationship represents the true ratio of dynamic to static pressure,
 so using that ratio the normal calculation of true airspeed can be used
 to determine the TAS measured by the gust pod.
 For this purpose, all the measurements from the calibration flight (RF15)
 were used qualified only by requiring TASX>130 m/s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurements entering the resulting fit are as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

=QCXC is the reference dynamic pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=$
\end_inset

PSXC is the reference ambient pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{g}=$
\end_inset

QC_GP is the gust-pod dynamic pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{g}$
\end_inset

=PS_GP is the gust-pod static pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the Mach number, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta P_{\alpha,g}$
\end_inset

=ADIFR_GP is the pressure difference between top and bottom pressure ports
 on the gust-pod sensor.
 The resulting fit is given by the following formula, with coefficients
 {b}={-0.07791, -1.1571, 2.6691, -1.3588, -0.0046686, 0.53110}:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{q}{p}=b_{0}+b_{1}\frac{q_{g}}{p_{g}}+b_{2}M\frac{q_{g}}{p_{g}}+b{}_{3}\left(\frac{q_{g}}{p_{g}}\right)^{2}+b_{3}\frac{\Delta p_{\alpha,g}}{q_{g}}+b_{5}M\label{eq:TASfit}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This complex fit was required to give a good representation of the measured
 ratio QCXC/PSXC, and a low-uncertainty fit is desirable because the true
 airspeed has very low potential uncertainty.
 All terms tested to be significant, and they were needed to reduce the
 residual error in 
\begin_inset Formula $q/p$
\end_inset

 to about 0.0001.

\begin_layout Standard
The vertical wind calculation depends on a measurement of vertical motion
 of the aircraft, which has been VSPD (from the IRU) or VSPD_G or GGVSPDB
 (from the GPS) or, much earlier, WP3.
 For the systems based on the gust pod or LAMS, additional vertical-velocity
 measurements are provided by their pod-mounted IRUs, respectively CVSPD_GP
 and CVSPD_LAMS.
 VSPD is controlled against the known instability of IRU measurements in
 the vertical by updating to a reference value provided by pressure altitude,
 so it has some drawbacks: pressure altitude is not really a measure of
 altitude but of pressure, so the reference altitude can be biased, and
 the IRU imposes an unknown baro-inertial loop with uncertain response character
istics and uncertainty.
 The advantage of an IRU variable over a GPS measurement has been, until
 recently, better response at high frequency at the expense of absolute
 accuracy.
 GPS measurements have now improved, esp.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

with OmniSTAR, so it is worth considering what variable or combination of
 variables should be used in the calculation of vertical wind.
 For horizontal wind, the standard solution in use since the early 1990s
 has been a complementary-filter solution where the difference between IRU
 and GPS measurements is low-pass filtered and the result is added to the
 IRU measurement.
 This preserves the high-frequency response of the IRU measurement but causes
 the low-frequency components to match the GPS measurements, thus providing
 both absolute accuracy and valid high-frequency measurements.
 It seems worthwhile to explore a similar approach for the vertical wind,
 to see if there is an advantage to a variable that is provided by an analogous
 complementary filter.
 When OMNISTAR is available, the measurement is so good that it may be preferabl
e to use that directly.
 That will be explored here also.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, two vertical-wind variables are produced from the radome-based
 system, WI and WIC.
 These are called, respectively, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Wind Vector, Vertical Gust Component
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GPS-Corrected Wind Vector, Vertical Gust Component
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They are calculated by adding the relative wind measured by the radome
 system to the vertical motion of the aircraft, either VSPD (WI) or GGVSPDB
 (WIC).
 The former is directly from the Honeywell IRU; the latter is produced by
 the GPS receiver and may benefit from OmniSTAR accuracy (flagged by GGQUAL
 equal to 5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The names are not really appropriate.
 Neither is the gust component; both are the full vertical wind including
 gust and mean.
 Also, WIC is not GPS-corrected, it is completely based on the GPS and does
 not use the IRU at all except as the attitude angles are involved in determinin
g the relative wind (the same for both).
 These calculations employ the nimbus function

In addition, the Honeywell IRU provides a measure of vertical acceleration.
 In a special calculation, this was integrated to get velocity and the result
 compared to VSPD.
 The variance spectrum was quite similar, provided that a feedback loop
 was used to avoid exponentially growing errors from positive feedback.

For evaluation of these measurements of aircraft velocity, it is useful
 to compare the variance spectra among them, including coherence and phase,
 and to evaluate the contribution made to the vertical wind.
 For this purpose, one flight from DEEPWAVE, RF16 (4 July 2014) was used
 because it provided a good example of relatively intense and prolonged
 vertical motion, with the core 6 h period of the flight from 6:30:00 --
 12:30:00 having a standard deviation in vertical wind of 1.0
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

 Much of the variation in vertical wind was from waves, so the field was
 not fully developed turbulence, but the signals to be resolved had enough
 intensity that noise floors on the measurements were not a problem.
 (See below for examples where noise does enter the measurements.)

 shows variance spectra calculated for the entire 6-h period, for a number
 of measurements entering vertical-wind calculations.
 The red trace shows the spectrum for the vertical wind measurement WIC,
 with a pronounced broad peak near 10 km wavelength, a relatively small
 inertial subrange extending only to about 3 km, and (after smoothing in
 50 logarithmic intervals across the range of the plot) uncertainty estimates
 that range from about 5% at the lowest frequencies to <1% at the highest
 frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The black trace, GUSTW, is the measurement of the vertical component of
 the relative wind.
 It is everywhere above the spectrum for WIC except above about 0.3 Hz.
 Because the vertical wind is the sum of GGVSPDB and GUSTW.
 At most frequencies, GUSTW and GGVSPDB make contributions having opposite
 sign, so that the resulting WIC is smaller than GUSTW; this is particularly
 evident at wavelengths longer than about 10 km, This can only arise if
 the amplitude of the aircraft vertical motion exceeds that of the vertical
 wind, causing the amplitude of the relative wind to exceed that of the
 vertical wind.
 At the lowest frequencies or longest wavelengths, there is little real
 signal in WIC so the measurements of relative wind and aircraft motion
 result almost entirely from aircraft motion and they almost cancel to produce
 a small spectral density for WIC.
 WIC exceeds WIC only at frequencies above about 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At frequencies above about 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz, the two IRU-only aircraft vertical speeds, VSPD and VSPD_A, begin to
 fall below the three measurements based solely on GPS or updated to GPS
 via Kalman filters.
 This causes the variance spectrum for WI (not shown) to fall well below
 that for WIC, and well below the 5/3-spectrum line, at the highest frequencies.
 Coherence between VSPD and GGVSPDB starts to drop above 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz and falls to near 0.5 at 0.5 Hz.
 Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Variance-spectra-VSPD"

\end_inset

 shows that VSPD also departs from GGVSPDB at frequencies below 0.01 Hz,
 leading to the spectrum for WI to lie above that for WIC at high frequency.
 The spectrum for VSPD_A is the same as that for VSPD except above about
 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz, where it decreases even faster than VSPD as frequency increases.
 The latter effect is probably the result of filtering internal to the IRUs
 providing the signals.
 This comparison suggests that WI (based on VSPD) has deficiencies and might
 better be eliminated from the data products.
 As a backup to WIC, a variable based on either one of the products updated
 to GPS measurements (CVSPD_GP or CVSPD_LAMS) would mostly match WIC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dark green spectrum represents GGVSPDB, the measurement from the GPS
 system.
 In this case, OMNISTAR corrections were available throughout the flight,
 so this is a low-uncertainty measurement and perhaps the best.
 In this plot, it is perfectly over-plotted by the violet and orange lines,
 except at frequencies above 0.1 Hz where there is a small departure.
 Even there, the measurements from the two pod-mounted systems (CVSPD_GP
 and CVSPD_LAMS), mounted on the same wing pylon in adjacent canisters,
 produce identical spectra.
 This was confirmed by very high coherence (>0.99 except near 1 Hz, where
 the coherence dropped to about 0.97) and phase within a few degrees of zero
 throughout the frequency range.
 This is exceptional agreement between two independent measurements (although
 they are not fully independent because both use a GPS signal in a Kalman
 filter to adjust their response, and both receive the same GPS signal but
 process it independently).
 The small departure between GGVSPDG (dark green) and CVSPD_LAMS (orange)
 occurs only a frequencies above 0.1 Hz.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider eliminating the variable WI from the data archives.
 VSPD, on which WI is based, has problems at both high and low frequency
 and tends to produce variance spectra with incorrect distributions at high
 frequencies where an inertial-subrange shape might be expected.
 Having this variable could lead to the mistaken expectation that this is
 the uncorrected version of WIC.
 The argument for using a variable based on VSPD has been that this represents
 the high-frequency contribution better than a GPS variable.
 That is not the case any longer, because GPS measurements have improved
 greatly and the IRU-provided measurements are obviously filtered at high
 frequency.
 Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

XXX shows that, while the variance spectra of WI and WIC are reasonably
 similar, the WI spectrum is above that for WIC for frequencies from about
 0.007--0.3 Hz, with WI often 30% higher, and then falls below the WIC spectrum
 above 0.3 Hz.
 The high-frequency decrease in WI is apparently attributable to the drop
 in VSPD at high frequency, thought to be from imposed filters in the IRU
 providing this variable.
 WIC is reasonably consistent with a -5/3 spectrum for frequencies above
 0.1 Hz, while WI is not.
 The difference in magnitude between 0.01--0.1 Hz is not evident: The variance
 spectra from VSPD and GGVSPDB have the same magnitude, coherence near unity
 and phase near zero, through this range.
 This needs further investigation unless the variable WI is no longer produced.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
VSPD does not have better frequency response than GGVSPDB at high frequency,
 as might be expected; the reverse is the case, possibly because of filters
 imposed on VSPD in the inertial unit itself.
 This argues for direct use of GGVSPDB in the vertical-wind calculation,
 at least when OMNISTAR corrections are available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The relative-wind variance spectrum exceeds that of the vertical wind, indicatin
g that the contribution from aircraft motion counters the relative-wind
 contribution at all but the highest frequencies.

) for frequencies smaller than 0.2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz.
 At low frequency, the motion of the aircraft probably produces the vertical
 component of the relative wind; at intermediate frequency (near 0.1 Hz)
 the aircraft perhaps responds to the vertical wind so as to move out-of-phase
 with it, exaggerating the measured vertical component of the relative wind.
 There is a transition in phase from being above 180
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 to being below 180
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 as the frequency increases through 0.05

 the vertical wind causes the aircraft response.

\begin_layout Enumerate
At high frequency (>0.3 Hz), the gust component dominates over the aircraft
 response and the coherence between them falls to values between 0.1--0.5

 The intensity of vertical-wind fluctuations was quite small for this flight
 segment, with a standard deviation in vertical wind of only about 0.2 m/s.
 Some features of this plot are explained below: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The measured vertical wind at high frequency (>1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz) is a white-noise spectrum with intensity that can be matched by generating
 a random-noise signal with peak amplitude of 0.15--0.2 m/s, which would lead
 to a random error of about (0.15--0.2)/
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{12}\simeq0.05$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s.
 The noise is dominated by the relative-wind contribution; there is essentially
 no contribution at these frequencies from the motion of the aircraft.
 The noise arises almost entirely from the angle-of-attack contribution
 to the relative wind, and specifically from the measurements 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ADIFR
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

QCR
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which exhibit noise spectra for frequencies above 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hz.
 In ADIFR, the noise is at a level that would arise from a white-noise signal
 with peak amplitude of 0.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

hPa or a random error of about 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

hPa.
 Similar noise is present in both QCR and QCF, so it may be linked to the
 nature of the transducers used or to some effect originating in the pressure
 lines connecting the transducers to the ports.
 The specifications for the pressure transducer that measures ADIFR assert
 a standard uncertainty of about 0.03 Hpa, and as sampled and digitized by
 the data system the resolution is about 0.002 hPa (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm70\,$
\end_inset

hPa for 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{16}$

 range digital encoding).
 Thus the white-noise spectrum indicates a random error about three times
 greater than expected from the transducer characteristics.
 This needs further investigation because it imposes an important limit
 on capability to measure low-intensity turbulence.

GGVSPDB as plotted here was obtained by interpolating linearly between 1-Hz
 measurements and then applying a low-pass filter with cutoff frequency

 which necessarily handles data second-by-second.
 [XXX check what is actually done for filtering and if a higher-rate is
 available for GGVSPDB.] VSPD (from the IRU), on the other hand, is present
 in the 25-Hz data files at 25 Hz, but it either has already been filtered
 in the IRU or simply reflects, with GGVSPDB, the absence of contributions
 from aircraft motion at these frequencies.
 It falls below even filtered GGVSPDB, though, so it probably doesn't represent
 any real signal at frequency above about 1 Hz.

Other attitude angles (heading and roll), which enter in minor ways if the

True airspeed, measured using the pitot-tube measurement of dynamic pressure,

 While no lag is assumed for dynamic pressure, the reference total temperature

 (No lag is assumed for RTRL, another candidate for the reference temperature.)

The vertical speed of the aircraft, taken for the preferred vertical wind
 variable from GGVSPDB, the variable produced by the Novatel GPS receiver

 This variable is only sampled at a rate of 5 Hz, and no time lag is used
 in processing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to try to determine appropriate lags from the data and from
 appropriate maneuvers.
 For example, in pitch maneuvers (in which the pitch is alternately increased
 and decreased with typically a 10-s period) if the timing of measurements
 of pitch and angle-of-attack are not matched or if the measurement of vertical
 speed of the aircraft is not timed correctly there will be a residual measured
 vertical wind, so these maneuvers are particularly stringent tests of relative
 timing of the signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An approximate formula for the vertical wind 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w=V\sin(\alpha-\phi)+w_{p}\label{eq:Weq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is angle-of-attack, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is pitch and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the vertical velocity of the aircraft.
 This equation can be used to adjust relative timing among the signals to
 minimize the variance in vertical wind during the pitch maneuvers.
 A good example is that from DEEPWAVE flight 15, 3:15--3:18 UTC.
 As initially processed using standard processing at the time of DEEPWAVE,
 the standard deviation in vertical wind through the pitch maneuvers was
 0.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s while the variance in vertical motion of the aircraft was 5.6
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s.
 A long-standing criterion for acceptable pitch maneuvers is for less than
 10% of the imposed velocity to enter the vertical wind, so by this criterion
 the test was successful.
 However, a plot of the vertical wind shows a clear match to the imposed
 velocity, so it is worthwhile to see if better results are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speed runs have been used to determine the sensitivity coefficients for
 determining 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 from the measured pressure differences on the radome, so the sensitivity
 coefficients should not be adjusted on the basis of the pitch maneuvers.

 be reduced.
 The sensors producing 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 are located close together and are processed in the standard manner by
 the data acquisition system, so these can be assumed to determine the reference
 time.
 However, the other variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 are determined by independent systems and may have timing offsets from
 the standard measurements, so these are the variables whose lags are explored
 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach was to shift the measurements forward or backward in time and,
 using Eq.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, recalculate the vertical wind.
 The best result obtained in this was was to shift PITCH forward 0.04

 Almost as good was to shift PITCH forward 0.08

 This reset the assumed lag in PITCH to zero while imposing a small lag

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s in GGVSPDB.
 For the purpose of this study, to avoid the phase lag produced by filters
 at the high-frequency limit, Savitzsky-Golay filtering was used for GGVSPDB
 with 4th-order polynomials applied over 25-measurement intervals to smooth
 the original measurements.
 The resulting standard deviation in WIX was 0.22
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s, vs 0.23 with no shift in GGVSPDB, so it may be preferable to leave the
 assumed lag for GGVSPDB at zero to avoid the awkwardness of advancing the
 measurement in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the assumed time lag in PITCH removed, the standard deviation in measured
 wind through the pitch maneuvers is only 4% of the imposed vertical motion
 of the aircraft.

Furthermore, there is little signal corresponding to the imposed vertical

\begin_layout Section
The complementary filter applied to horizontal components
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wind measurements combine a measurement of relative wind with a measurement
 of aircraft motion to determine the air motion relative to the ground.
 The aircraft motion has long been measured by an IRS, and recently also
 by a GPS.
 These have complementary strengths: The IRS provides very good information
 on short-term motion but drifts with a characteristic period of more than
 an hour, while the GPS provides good absolute accuracy but sometimes is
 unable to receive the GPS signals and (except in differential-GPS mode)
 can have short-term errors that make short segments of the track look jagged.
 To take advantage of the strengths of each, a complementary-filter calculation
 was developed and implemented in the 1980s, but it was never documented
 publicly.
 This section is partly an attempt to remedy that and partly a suggestion
 to make some minor changes to how it is implemented.
 This discussion is complementary to the information in ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf,
 section 3.4, and contains additional detail as well as notes regarding implement
ation of changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To accomplish this combining of measurements, a low-pass filter, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{L}(\{\mathrm{GVNS,GVEW\}})$
\end_inset

, is applied to the GPS measurements of groundspeed, {GVNS,GVEW}, which
 are assumed to be valid for frequencies at or lower than the cutoff frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

 of the filter.
 Then the complementary high-pass filter, denoted (
\begin_inset Formula $1-F_{L}$
\end_inset

)(
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathrm{VNS,VEW\}}$
\end_inset

), is applied to the IRS measurements of groundspeed, {VNS,VEW}, which are
 assumed valid for frequencies at or higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Ideally, the transition frequency would be selected where the GPS errors
 (increasing with frequency) are equal to the IRS errors (decreasing with
 frequency).
 The filter used is a three-pole Butterworth lowpass filter, coded following
 the algorithm described in Bosic, S.

\end_inset

M., 1980: 
\emph on
Digital and Kalman filtering : An Introduction to Discrete-Time Filtering
 and Optimum Linear Estimation, 
\emph default
p.
 49.
 The digital filter used is recursive, not centered, to permit calculation
 during a single pass through the data.
 If the cutoff frequency lies where both the GPS and INS measurements are
 valid and are almost the same, then the detailed characteristics of the
 filter in the transition region (e.g., phase shift) do not matter because
 the complementary filters have cancelling effects when applied to the same
 signal.
 The transition frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

 was chosen to be (1/600) Hz (but this value can be overridden via the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defaults

 file).
 The Butterworth filter was chosen because it provides flat response away
 from the transition.
 The resulting variables for aircraft motion, {VNSC,VEWC}, are then each
 the sum of two filtered signals, calculated as described in the following

This is straightforward and effective when both sets of measurements (IRS
 and GPS) are available.
 The approach in use becomes more complicated when the GPS signals are lost,
 as sometimes happens in sharp turns.
 Then some means is needed to avoid sudden discontinuities in velocity (and
 hence windspeed), which would introduce spurious effects into variance
 spectra and other properties dependent on a continuously valid measurement
 of wind.
 To extrapolate measurements through periods when the GPS measurements are
 not available, a fit is determined to the difference between the best-estimate
 variables {VNSC,VEWC} and the IRS variables {VNS,VEW} for the period before
 GPS reception was lost, and that fit is used to extrapolate through periods
 when GPS reception is not available.
 The procedure is described in section 3.4 of ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf.

\begin_layout Standard
The following provides more documentation of the fit procedure used to determine
 the Schuler oscillation.
 The errors are assumed to result primarily from this oscillation, so the
 three-term fit is of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=c_{1}+c_{2}\sin(\Omega_{Sch}t)+c_{3}\cos(\Omega_{Sch}t)$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{Sch}$
\end_inset

 is the angular frequency of the Schuler oscillation (taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi/(5067\, s))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the time since the start of the flight.
 A separate fit is used for each component of the velocity and each component
 of the position (discussed below under LATC and LONC).
 The fit matrix used to determine these coefficients is updated each time
 step but the accumulated fit factors decay exponentially with about 30-min
 decay constant, so the terms used to determine the fit are exponentially
 weighted over the period of valid data with a time constant that decays
 exponentially into the past with a characteristic time of 30 min.
 This is long enough to determine a significant portion of the Schuler oscillati
on but short enough to emphasize recent measurements of the correction.
 The procedures for accumulating the matrices for the fit are as follows:

The error in pitch arises from measurements from the IRU and is affected
 mostly by an initial offset during alignment and then further changes in
 this error arising from the Schuler oscillation and from accelerations
 that affect this error.
 The error in angle-of-attack, on the other hand, arises from a combination
 of measurement error from the pressure transducers and error in the formula
 used to deduce angle-of-attack from the pressure measurements.
 However, the calibration of the radome to determine sensitivity coefficients
 for calculating angle-of-attack relies on matching the angle-of-attack
 to the pitch angle when the aircraft flies level and there is no vertical
 wind, so a calibration error in pitch would produce the same calibration
 error in angle-of-attack and errors that are positively correlated.
 This positive correlation would reduce the net variance in vertical-wind
 measurements, but other errors arising from sources like uncertainty in
 the measurements from the pressure transducers likely produce errors in
 angle-of-attack uncorrelated with those in pitch.
 The calibration procedure averages over long periods of flight during which
 any pitch error likely undergoes a Schuler oscillation and other changes,
 so the angle-of-attack calibration averages over such errors in pitch.
 Because of these arguments and the difficulty of determining the true correlati
on between these errors, it seems appropriate to drop the correlation term
 from Eq.

It is possible to estimate the magnitudes of these errors from measurements.
 Because the GV instrumention includes two identical inertial systems, the

 The estimated uncertainties in angle-of-attack and pitch are thus comparable,
 and both influence the uncertainty in vertical wind.
 The rough-estimate uncertainty in vertical wind (to be refined later) is,
 for flight at about 230

m/s, about 
\begin_inset Formula $230\sqrt{0.0003^{2}+0.00035^{2}}\simeq0.1$

\begin_layout Paragraph
Horizontal wind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Errors in measurements affect the longitudinal and lateral components of
 the horizontal wind in different ways.
 For the longitudinal component, and relative-wind measurement has been
 calibrated by comparison to measurements of the single-beam LAMS to an
 estimated standard uncertainty of about 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s (Cooper et al., 2014).
 The lateral component is measured using the sideslip angle, which is determined
 in a manner similar to that used to calibrate the measurement of angle-of-attac
k.
 However, the zero reference angle for attack is determined well by assuming
 that, on average in quiescent air, the vertical wind should be zero.
 No similar reference angle exists for sideslip, and trim adjustments to
 the aircraft can change the mean sideslip angle, so a different procedure
 with additional sources of uncertainty must be used.
 Two maneuvers are particularly effective for determining the zero reference
 for sideslip (at which angle the lateral horizontal component of the relative
 wind would be zero): (i) Reverse-heading maneuvers, where a straight leg
 is flown for a short time (typically 2 min), then the flight track reverses
 heading and flies back along the reverse heading, with the result that
 the wind component perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft
 should reverse sign; or (ii) constant-bank circles flown drifting with
 the wind, for which the lateral component of the wind should exhibit a
 sinusoidal variation around the circle.
 Both can provide a reference for zero sideslip angle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for vertical wind, the GPS-measured components of aircraft motion relative
 to the Earth have uncertainty significantly less than that of the relative
 wind, so errors are dominated by those arising from the relative-wind component
s.
 The first-order equation for the lateral component of the relative wind
 (
\begin_inset Formula $v_{y}$
\end_inset

), analogous to Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Weq-1"

\end_inset

, is 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{y}=V\psi$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is the sideslip angle, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is known to typically 0.05% so the error is dominated by that in sideslip.
 For the random error, one limit is obtained as for angle-of-attack by examining
 the variance spectrum in calm conditions.
 However, BDIFR and SSLIP do not exhibit such pure noise spectra at high
 frequency as did ADIFR and AKRD.
 QCF and QCF show noise spectra representative of random errors of about
 0.15
\begin_inset space ~

 For BDIFR, an example is shown in Fig.

\begin_layout Standard
The slope in the high-frequency region does not match that expected for
 a white-noise signal, for which the variance would be constant and in these
 plots, where the spectral density is multiplied by the frequency, the plotted
 line should increase linearly with frequency parallel to the orange dashed
 lines.
 Instead, the spectrum for BDIFR has smaller slope than this, looking perhaps
 as if the spectrum starts out at a point where a white-noise spectrum with
 standard deviation 0.1

 so that at the high-frequency limit the equivalent white-noise standard
 deviation would be 0.05
\begin_inset space ~

hPa.
 The spectrum for SSLIP looks similarly filtered, with an equivalent white-noise
 spectrum somewhere in the range of 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

, similar to that characterizing AKRD.
 The resulting preliminary estimate of the standard uncertainty in the lateral
 component of the relative wind is about 0.1
\begin_inset space ~

m/s, as for the vertical wind.
 Like vertical wind, this needs to be refined for application to the Earth-relat
ive wind by consideration of the uncertainty in the determination of sensitivity
 coefficients for sideslip, the uncertainty in heading (needed for transformatio
n to coordinates fixed relative to the Earth), and other contributions to
 the net uncertainty in wind.
