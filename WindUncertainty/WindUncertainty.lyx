\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wind is the motion of the atmosphere relative to the Earth.
 Most reseearch aircraft have the capability to measure wind, and these
 measurements have many uses in research projects using aircraft.
 They help define the flow and so provide context for other measurements,
 and they are often used to study fluxes of atmospheric constituents, turbulence
, wave motions, cloud updrafts and downdrafts, convergence and divergence,
 and many other topics.
 They can provide important information transferred to models for data assimilat
ion or for validation tests of model results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The range and endurance of the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

V research aircraft (operated by the Research Aviation Facility, Earth Observing
 Laboratory, NCAR) makes it possible to measure wind over large distances
 and so to characterize mesoscale and even larger features in the atmosphere.
 However, the high speed of that aircraft (typically Mach 0.8, or about 240
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

 for flight near 40,000 ft) poses special problems for wind measurement.
 The flow distortion around the aircraft perturbs pressure measurements
 that are central to the measurement of wind, and the measurement of air
 temperature, needed in the calculation of wind, requires corrections of
 typically more than 20
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

C to account for dynamic heating of the sensors.
 Accurate measurement of wind thus is particularly challenging on this and
 other high-speed aircraft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report documents how measurements of wind are made from the NSF/NCAR
 Gulfstream
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

V research aircraft (hereafter, GV) and provides a characterization of the
 uncertainty associated with those measurements.
 The characterization applies to the system as it existed in 2014, in particular
 as it operated in the DEEPWAVE research project flown from New Zealand
 in June-July 2014.
 Key features of the instrumentation influencing the uncertainty in the
 measurements as characterized here are the presence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

OmniSTAR
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 GPS (Global Positioning System) measurements, providing measurements of
 the velocity of the aircraft relative to the earth, a calibration of airspeed
 provided by the Laser Air Motion Sensor (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "CooperEtAl2014"

\end_inset

), and a newly developed all-weather wind sensor or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gust pod
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 employing a Rosemount 858 probe mounted under the wing of the GV.
 These complemented the standard wind-sensing system comprised of a Honeywell
 Laseref IV inertial reference unit, GPS measurements from Novatel and Garmin
 units, and a gust-sensing system based on pressure ports in the nose radome.
 The results obtained here do not necessarily apply to measurements from
 earlier projects when not all these components were available in their
 present form, but they should apply to measurements subsequent to 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Components"

\end_inset

 describes the components of the wind-measuring system in more detail, with
 examples of the measurements and information on the specifications for
 the sensors involved.
 That is followed by a section that develops a correction procedure for
 pitch because that correction and the evidence it provides regarding uncertaint
y are used in subsequent sections.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Calibrations"

\end_inset

 summarizes how the measurements have been calibrated, tested, and intercompared.
 Some related studies affecting the measurements are then presented in the
 next two sections.
 The section discussing vertical wind focuses on studies of the measurement
 of aircraft vertical motion, needed to calculate the vertical wind, while
 that discussing horizontal wind uses circle maneuvers to check the measurement
 of horizontal wind and develop corrections to the heading and sideslip.
 This information then provides the basis for Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Uncertainty-components"

\end_inset

, where the contributions to uncertainty from various sources are tabulated
 and where there is a discussion of the basis for each estimate contributing
 to uncertainty in the measured wind.
 That section then concludes with a summary characterizing the overall uncertain
ty and the separate systematic and random components included in that uncertaint
y.
 There is also an appendix on reproducibility of these analyses that describes
 the programs used for these calculations and documents where they and the
 data can be found.

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the measurement components differ, for each of these the measurement
 of wind involves the vector sum of two components, the motion of the air
 relative to the aircraft and the motion of the aircraft relative to the
 Earth.
 The former is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relative wind
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and is measured as a three-component vector having magnitude equal to the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true airspeed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and angles relative to the aircraft reference frame characterized by the
 angle of attack and the sideslip angle.
 The angle of attack is considered positive if the relative wind is from
 below the aircraft, and the sideslip angle is considered positive if the
 relative wind is from the starboard side of the aircraft.
 The relative wind defined in the coordinate system of the aircraft (conventiona
lly with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 forward, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 in the starboard direction, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 obtained from the cross product 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x^{\prime}}\times\hat{y^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 and so approximately downward but oriented to align with the aircraft reference
 frame) must be transformed to an Earth-based reference system (conventionally
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}$
\end_inset

 toward east, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{y}$
\end_inset

 toward north, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z}$
\end_inset

 upward) so that the components can be combined to yield the Earth-relative
 wind.
 This transformation is a function of the attitude angles of the aircraft
 (heading 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, pitch 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, and roll 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

), measured by an inertial reference unit in all three cases discussed here.
 Once in an Earth-based reference system, the relative wind vector is added
 to the vector representing the aircraft motion relative to the Earth to
 obtain the wind.
 The sources of the various measurements entering this processing sequence
 vary among the three systems and will be discussed separately below for
 each system.

\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}V^{*}\\
V^{*}\thinspace\tan\beta\\
V^{*}\thinspace\tan\alpha
\end{pmatrix}\label{eq:relative wind}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where, if 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is the true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}=$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $V/\sqrt{1+\tan^{2}\alpha+\tan^{2}\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the component of true airspeed along the aircraft longitudinal (
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

) axis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the angle of attack and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 the sideslip angle.
 The sign convention is such that the relative wind is positive when 
\emph on
from 
\emph default
the direction of the axis for each component.
 (The magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is thus 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 as required.) The relative wind is therefore determined from measurements
 of true airspeed, angle of attack, and sideslip angle.

Transformation to an Earth reference frame
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orientations of the aircraft, the gust pod, and the LAMS are measured
 by IRUs located respectively in the fuselage and in the pod itself.
 Each independently measures heading, pitch, and roll, so the calculations
 of wind from the three systems can be fully independent except that, because
 it is considered to have the smallest uncertainty, the true airspeed measured
 from the fuselage system is used also for the gust pod.
 In each case, the IRU measurements and GPS ground-speed components are
 used to transform the measurements to the reference frame of the Earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The required transformation is described by three rotation matrices, defined
 in

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An additional correction is applied to account for the effect of the rotation
 rate of the aircraft on the measurements.
 This correction is needed when the reference unit for motion relative to
 the Earth, the IRU, is separated from the measurement of relative wind
 on the radome or gust pod.
 For the gust pod, this is negligible because the IRU is co-located with
 the gust-measuring system.
 See the cited reference for details.

 There are duplicate inertial systems, so a measure of uncertainty is how
 well they agree.
 For DEEPWAVE flight 16, the mean difference in pitch was 0.2
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and the standard deviation in the difference between measurements was about
 0.015
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 (for measurements with absolute value of the roll smaller than 3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

), and if the measurements are filtered to remove variations with period
 exceeding about 1000
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s the slowly varying component of the difference has standard deviation
 of about 0.012
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 while the fast-varying component has standard deviation of 0.008
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 This was characteristic of most flights, although there were two (8 and
 20) that had slightly larger standard deviations.
 The project averages were 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 for the slow component and about 0.007
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 for the fast component.
 This is an indication that the system performs better than indicated by
 the specifications, and indeed additional evidence for this is provided
 in Section 3.
 The difference in pitch and enhanced standard deviation in turns likely
 arises from small mis-alignment of the units relative to the longitudinal
 axis of the aircraft.
 As discussed in Section 3, the error in pitch tends to precess with a period
 of about 84.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

min, so the slowly varying component tends to be dominated by this precession
 which, for periods short compared to 84.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

min, introduces a bias while the faster varying component has the character
 of a random error.

 pressure is measured on the GV at pressure ports called static buttons
 that are located at positions on the fuselage where in normal flight the
 pressure is approximately the pressure present outside the airflow disturbance
 produced by the aircraft.
 Because there are residual effects of airflow that change with angle of
 attack and Mach number, corrections are applied to these measurements to
 obtain better representation of the true ambient pressure.
 These corrections are described in

\begin_layout Standard
The dynamic pressure is the pressure difference above ambient that develops
 if air is compressed and adiabatically brought to rest relative to the
 moving aircraft.
 The total pressure, the sum of ambient and dynamic pressure, is sensed
 using a pitot tube, a tube pointed in the direction of the relative airflow
 and specially designed to be relatively insensitive to small-angle changes
 in the direction of the relative airflow.
 Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:pitot-tube-photo"

\end_inset

 shows the location of the research-system pitot tube on the GV as well
 as one of the avionics-system pitot tubes.
 The excess pressure above the ambient sensed by a pitot tube or, approximately,
 by the center port on the radome is equal to 0.5 times the air density times
 the airspeed squared, so this excess pressure can be used to determine
 the airspeed of the aircraft.
 On NSF/NCAR aircraft, the measurement of dynamic pressure is made using
 differential sensors connected between a static source and a total-pressure
 source from either a pitot tube (QCF) or the front port on the radome (QCR).
 The sensor used, with characteristics listed in Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Radome-system-measurements"

\end_inset

, has these additional characteristics: Specified resolution is 0.0011% of
 full scale or 0.0076 hPa, which is better than 16-bit resolution; maximum
 sampling rate 120 Hz; response time 50ms and response delay 21 ms at 50
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Because any errors affecting the measurement of static pressure also affect
 the difference between dynamic and static pressure, the same corrections
 that are applied to static pressure (for errors in the pressure delivered

 There are three units on the aircraft, two of which are recorded via the

 These are strap-down ring laser gyro micro inertial systems.
 The measurements of ground-speed components are affected by errors that
 arise from initial alignment errors or orientation errors resulting from
 gyro responses to acceleration and so often exhibit a characteristic Schuler
 oscillation with magnitude that can be as much as 1--3 m

 This is the primary source of error in the measurements, so for aircraft
 velocity components it is important to remove these errors by comparison
 to lower-uncertainty measurements provided by the GPS that are not subject
 to the Schuler oscillation.
 In addition, there are signal delays that are accounted for in post processing
 to align measurements with other recorded data, and there are some inherent
 filters in the IRU computer that affect the signals transmitted to the
 GV data system.
 The orientation of this unit was defined and checked by initial survey

 The large difference in pitch is a result of the gust pod being installed
 in a canister below the wind where it points downward by several degrees
 relative to the aircraft longitudinal axis.
 (The pods were designed this way to provide better approaching airflow
 for cloud-imaging probes and other sampling from the airstream.) There is
 also a significant difference in heading and in roll for similar reasons.

 angle-of-attack and sideslip angle calculated from those pressure differences.
 The calculation is described in Section 4 of this document.
 Fluctuations in sideslip angle are seldom more than a fraction of a degree,
 while there can be several-degree fluctuations in the angle-of-attack.
 The gradual decrease in angle-of-attack is a result of the change in fuel
 load on the aircraft, which requires a smaller angle-of-attack to keep
 the aircraft level as the weight becomes smaller.

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The all-weather wind pod was developed by Allen Schanot and is available
 for mounting under the wing of the GV, where it was installed during the
 2014 project DEEPWAVE.
 It was still regarded as experimental for this project, and this is the
 first full documentation of its characteristics.
 It will be called the gust-pod system here; another name used has been
 the all-weather wind pod, because the primary reason for its development
 was to provide a backup wind measurement for cases when the radome system
 was not available, including times when it was blocked by ice or frozen
 water in the pressure lines.
 The gust pod fits into a standard 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PMS-style
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 canister and uses a Rosemount 858 probe, but the location under the wing
 is one where there is substantial flow distortion in comparison to the
 free stream so an unconventional calibration is needed to use the measurements.
 The 858 probe is anti-iced by heaters and should be unaffected by icing
 or ice accumulation.
 Five ports are oriented forward, upward and downward 45
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and left and right 45
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 on the leading edge of the sensor, which has the shape of a hemisphere.
 There are also ports in a ring around the cylinder behind the hemisphere
 that provide a static source.
 The measurements are the pressure difference between the top and bottom
 ports (ADIF_GP), the pressure difference between the right and left ports
 (BDIF_GP), and the pressure difference between the forward port and the
 static ports (QC_GP).
 In addition, the pressure provided by the ring of static ports is recorded
 as PS_GP.
 The system incorporates a Systron-Donner C-MIGITSIII IRU, which is mounted
 in the pod to be able to measure vibrations and wing-flex motions that
 will affect the measurements of wind.
 This unit provides measurements of attitude angles, ground-speed components,
 and accelerations and uses a GPS signal in a Kalman-filter feedback loop
 to reduce errors in the measurements.
 The relevant specifications are listed in Table

mrad.
 Some contribution would be expected from vibrations and wing flex that
 affect the gust pod, so these comparisons are good support for the approximate
 validity of the specifications.
 Some of the specifications (esp.
\begin_inset space ~

for heading) degrade in the absence of turns or maneuvers that can be used
 by the Kalman filter to improve the measurements.
\end_layout

Ambient pressure (variable PS_GP) is measured by a digital transducer with

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 However, the Rosemount 858 probe is located under the wing in a location
 where there is significant airflow distortion, so these measurements often
 differ from the measurements from the static buttons on the fuselage by
 10--20
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa and significant corrections are needed if these measurements are to
 be used for pressure measurements.
 With the gust-pod, the use is as a reference for the differential measurement
 of dynamic pressure because the dynamic-pressure transducer is connected
 between the total-pressure port on the front of the 858 probe and the static
 ports.
 No calibration has been determined that would make this measurement useful
 as a measure of true ambient pressure, although that could be done by fitting
 to match the standard static pressure.
 In the absence of such a correction, PS_GP should not be considered an
 alternate measurement of ambient pressure.
 The use of this measurement to determine an alternate measure of true airspeed
 will be discussed in Section

.
 The measurement is the pressure difference between the forward-pointing
 port on the Rosemount 858 probe and the static ports on the side of that
 probe.
 Because the system is located under the wing in a region of disturbed airflow,
 the dynamic pressure requires unconventional correction to obtain the airspeed,
 as discussed in Sect.

 A new calibration is developed in Section

 On the basis of that new calibration, it appears that the gust pod provides
 a useful alternative to wind measurements based on the radome.
 Plots and average values are presented there to support the validity of
 this measurement.

This is a good illustration of performance because this is a flight with
 large-amplitude waves and some of the largest vertical-wind measurements
 in the DEEPWAVE project, so the consistency of these measurements even
 to extremes in this plot indicates that the measurements from the gust
 pod are useful even for these large-amplitude measurements.

Some spikes would occur in turns if the exclusions listed in the figure
 caption were not applied to the measurements from the gust pod.
 These are the result of a problem with the C-MIGITSIII measurement of heading,
 which exhibits noisy fluctuations as it moves through 180

 These fluctuations introduce large perturbations in the horizontal wind
 measurements, affecting esp.

 The two measurements match quite well in regard to the structure of these
 waves and the amplitudes of the fluctuations.
 The measurements of horizontal wind speed are in similar agreement, but
 the wind direction for this period shows an offset for the gust pod measurement
 relative to the conventional measurement, varying from about 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 near the start of this period to about 1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 near the end.
 This is a result of an apparent error in heading from the C-MIGITS IRU,
 a common feature to see near the start of flights but one that usually
 was made smaller during flight by the action of the GPS updating via Kalman
 filter in that unit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of this error in wind direction and the problems with measured
 heading for flight exactly southbound complicate the use of the measurements
 of horizontal wind from the gust pod and make them of lesser quality that
 the standard measurements.
 Fortunately, in this and most projects, the horizontal-wind measurements
 are available from the radome-based system on all flights and are usually
 not compromised even when there is loss of the measurement of angle-of-attack
 from plugging of the lines in the radome, because the side-mounted ports
 for the measurement of sideslip seldom are plugged.

Figure

 shows the high-rate variance spectra from the two systems.
 There is a significant difference at frequencies above about 3 Hz, with
 the gust-pod distribution dropping faster and the standard wind WIC showing
 more variance.
 The high frequency spectrum from the gust pod may be more realistic; it
 is unusual to see high variance at these frequencies without a related
 generating source.
 The coherence between the radome and gust-pod measurements was above 0.9
 for frequencies less than 1 Hz but then fell to around 0.2 at 10 Hz.
 This is an indication that the two measurements are different in important
 ways at high frequency.
 This would not be the case if they were responding with different amplitudes;
 the signals must really be mostly incoherent at the highest frequency.
 The separation wing-to-fuselage is about 7 m lateral and 13 m longitudinal,
 so that doesn't seem enough to cause the low high-frequency coherence.
 The phase changes from in-phase at frequencies less than 1 Hz to 180
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 out-of-phase at 9 Hz, with WIG lagging, so this is consistent with the
 longitudinal offset.
 Shifting WIG relative to WIC also gave maximum coherence when WIG was shifted
 forward 1/25 s.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The attitude angles (pitch, roll, heading) as measured by the gust-pod IRU
 are defined relative to the orientation of the inertial unit in the gust
 pod, which is aligned a few degrees from the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
 The canisters on the GV are oriented with axis pointing inward and downward
 relative to the aircraft longitudinal axis, in order to align with normal
 airflow at the pods.
 This is desirable for hydrometeor sampling and minimum drag, but it complicates
 the calculation of wind because roll introduced in turns, primarily a rotation
 about the aircraft longitudinal axis, will appear as a combination of attitude-
angle changes in the gust pod.
 Errors arising from the initial alignment at the start of flights will
 also cause problems with the measured attitude angles, and it is likely
 that these will be more significant near the start of flights because the
 built-in Kalman filter uses GPS measurements to correct such errors in
 the course of the flight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem with the reference frame for attitude angles has two consequences:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Measurements from the gust pod in turns have large errors in comparison
 to the errors in level flight.
 The measurements from the gust pod should probably be flagged as of poor
 quality whenever the roll exceeds some threshold like perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm5^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 The measurements usually look reasonable in turns despite this worry, but
 the largest errors occur there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There may be an offset introduced by the mixing of sideslip and angle-of-attack,
 arising from the difference in roll angle, and this will affect the reference
 or average value of the measured vertical wind.
 Some flights (e.g., DEEPWAVE flight 18) have a significant offset in vertical
 wind from the gust pod at the start of the flight that is related to offsets
 in heading and roll, gradually corrected in the course of the flight via
 the C-MIGITSIII Kalman filter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the weight of the aircraft decreases during the flight, so does
 the angle-of-attack.
 Because the wing flexes, the measured sideslip at the gust pod also varies
 with weight of the aircraft.
 This change in sideslip causes an offset in the mean lateral component
 of the wind.

\begin_layout Standard
These effects suggest that the vertical wind measured by the gust pod may
 have an offset in some cases, particularly at the start of flights, and
 the sideslip can also have an offset that will contribute to the lateral
 component of the measured wind.
 These are weaknesses in the measurements from the gust pod that, at this
 stage, do not appear easily corrected.
 A future study implementing Schuler tuning in a post-processing step and
 correcting for the entwined-angle effects may be able to reduce these weaknesse
s, but that will require continued analysis not performed for this report.

Diagram of the LAMS.
 Light generated by the laser in the cabin is transmitted by optical fibres
 to a

wing pod, where it is transmitted in a beam that has a
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

focal point well ahead of the aircraft (farther ahead than suggested by
 this not-to-scale diagram).
 The light backscattered from aerosol particles in the focal region is collected
 by the lens, and a circulator mixes a
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

portion of the transmitted signal with the returned signal.
 The resulting signal, with interference patterns that measure the Doppler
 shift of the backscattered light, is returned via optical fibre to the
 cabin for digitization.
 Also illustrated in this figure are the approximate locations of the static
 pressure ports and the fuselage pitot tube used by the research data system
 to measure static and dynamic pressures.

\begin_layout Standard
The system consists of one, three or four fiber-based laser beams focused
 ahead of the aircraft and a collection system to detect the Doppler shift
 in light backscattered from aerosols.
 The transmitter optical components are mounted in an underwing pod, similar
 to that used for the gust pod, and like the gust pod the system incorporates
 a compact C-MIGITS inertial reference unit to measure the attitude angles
 and ground speed of the pod.
 Early measurements from this system have been used to determine corrections
 to the pressure measurements, and those serve an important role in reducing
 uncertainty in the wind measurements, as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

LAMS hardware supports up to four beams, with three pointing 
\begin_inset Formula $35^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 off the forward direction, with 
\begin_inset Formula $120^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 separation about the azimuthal direction.
 The fourth beam is directed forward from the LAMS unit.
 The LAMS channel designations changed after DEEPWAVE (summer 2014) when
 it was decided the instrument would benefit from having a lower noise channel
 for forward pointing measurements (the laser/detector on channel 4 had
 lower SNR than the other three channels).
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:BeamConfig"

\end_inset

 summarizes the labels and pointing angles of each beam for both up to and
 after DEEPWAVE.
 Note the number designation refers to the laser, detector, and data processing
 channels.
 The letter designation is associated with the exit window on the LAMS head.
 The pointing angles reported here are ideal.
 The angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is measured relative to the forward direction of the LAMS pod (approximately
 the angle between the beam and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

) and the angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is the rotation angle about 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 relative to the 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{z^{\prime}}$
\end_inset

 axis.
 This geometry is designed for GV installation where the LAMS pod is installed
 on the left wing, outboard pylon, outboard position.
 The pointing geometry relative to the aircraft may change based on the
 installation configuration on the C-130 (to be determined on ARISTO in
 fall 2015) where the LAMS optical fiber are routed to the aircraft right
 wing.

Designations and ideal orientations of LAMS beams for installation on the

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During IDEAS-4-GV, the LAMS beams were focused approximately 15 m from the
 LAMS exit ports on the pod.
 After this flight program, concerns were raised about the aircraft causing
 flow distortion in the LAMS sample volumes, and the beam focus was moved
 to 20 m from the exit port.
 In both cases the sample volume is approximately 2 m long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Relative Beam Pointing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relative pointing of the LAMS beams is defined by the orientation of
 each beam relative to the others.
 If the absolute pointing direction of one beam is known, the relative pointing
 may be used to determine the absolute pointing of all other beams.
 We define the relative pointing coordinates such that the z-axis is directed
 along the forward beam (D).
 The angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{L}$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the beam and the z-axis and the azimuthal angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{L}$
\end_inset

 is measured relative to the x-axis such that beam 1 (A) is positioned at
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{L}=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two methods were used to determine the relative pointing angles.
 The first, performed prior to IDEAS-4-GV, used a Laser Survey, in which
 a commercial laser surveying company measured the positions of the LAMS
 head and the beam focal points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second method used a 30x beam expanded with focusing lens in a fixed
 position (referred to here as the receiver system) while LAMS was mounted
 in an astronomical telescope mount.
 A camera was placed at the focal point of the receiver system and the telescope
 mount was used to steer the LAMS beams into the receiver system such that
 each beam was centered on the CCD.
 This method had redundant pointing measurements, using both C-MIGITS data
 as well as the telescope mount angle read-outs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both methods were relatively accurate, with less than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 difference in beam pointing.
 It should be noted that the fibers on the LAMS head may have moved slightly
 between the two measurement methods.
 The forward pointing beam was added after IDEAS-4-GV which required some
 disassembly of the LAMS head.
 So the relatively small difference in beam pointing may be partially attributab
le to that work.

%The beam pointing results from the telescope measurement system are typically
 used going forward, first because they are the most recent beam pointing
 measurements, but also because redundant measurements and the position
 invariance of Fourier plane measurements generally illicit greater confidence
 in those pointing results.

Prior to IDEAS-4-GV, a laser survey system was used to estimate the LAMS
 beam pointing angles of Beams 1, 2, and 3 (the forward pointing beam had
 not been added at that point).
 The LAMS head was positioned in the hanger so the bottom two beams were
 approximately parallel to the floor.
 Two IR card targets were placed at the focal points of those beams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The laser survey system locked onto a corner cube reflector and register
 its position in space.
 The corner cube was first used to estimate the position of the LAMS exit
 ports by taking a series of points around their circumference.
 The tracker then registered the positions of the IR card targets by the
 same method.
 Once complete, the LAMS head was rotated by 
\begin_inset Formula $120^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and the process was repeated.
 This measurement was repeated for three different LAMS head rotations,
 where two beams were surveyed at a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After data was collected, the beam exit and target information were used
 to provide a best fit for the beam pointing.

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Itemize

 to quantify.
\end_layout

The survey can be expensive, requiring the hire of an outside vendor.
 
\end_layout

 but those angle calibrations have since been traded for the Telescope technique
 described below.

\begin_layout Standard
The relative positions of the LAMS system can be determined by defining
 a fixed reference vector and directing each beam onto it.
 The pointing of the LAMS module is recorded when each beam is directed
 on the reference.
 Without absolute knowledge of the reference vector, this only allows the
 relative beam geometry to be determined.
 Thus, we define a LAMS beam pointing coordinate frame such that the z-axis
 is along the forward beam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The telescope beam measurement system was developed in house to provide
 position insensitive angular measurement.
 It uses a 30x beam expander consisting of an off axis parabola and convex
 secondary (exact type is unknown).
 The light from that beam expander is focused onto an IR card using a 50
 mm lens, yielding a total focal length of 1.5 m.
 The IR card was then reimaged using a 45 mm lens onto a CCD to monitor
 the beam position (see Figure

\begin_layout Standard
With the IR card at the back focus of the optical system, the beam image
 is position independent.
 Its location in this plane is dictated solely by the angle of the input
 beam.
 Even though each beam is slightly translated relative to its counterparts,
 we can still perform accurate angle measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LAMS system is mounted in a precision telescope mount with accuracy
 on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $1^{\prime\prime}$
\end_inset

 or about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0003^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 The mount gives fine resolution in adjusting LAMS pointing into the receiver
 reference system and provides a digital readout of Alt/Az coordinates.
 These coordinates provide the first set of pointing data for the LAMS system.
 The second set of pointing data is provided by the C-MIGITS INS, which
 is attached and operating during our data collection.
 Thus, two measurements of the LAMS pointing are provided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The telescope mount readout provides the quantities Alt, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vartheta_{T}$
\end_inset

, and Az, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{T}$
\end_inset

.
 When a beam is directed into the reference telescope, it is accomplished
 through rotation operations: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{r}=\mathbf{R}(\vartheta_{T},\hat{x})\mathbf{R}(\varphi_{T},\hat{y})\hat{u},\label{TelMountReference}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}$
\end_inset

 is the reference direction of the receiving telescope, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}$
\end_inset

 is the beam pointing direction and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{R}(\theta,\hat{v})$
\end_inset

 is a rotation matrix of angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 about the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{v}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the beam pointing angle, we invert the rotation operations
 (or perform the opposite rotations in the opposite order), which results
 in 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{u}=\mathbf{R}(-\varphi_{T},\hat{y})\mathbf{R}(-\vartheta_{T},\hat{x})\hat{r}.\label{TelMountBeam}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To obtain a beam pointing vector, we first need to know the reference vector
 in some coordinate basis.
 We let Beam 4 (the forward pointing beam) define the z-axis in this coordinate
 basis and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}$
\end_inset

 by evaluating Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "TelMountReference"

\end_inset

 for the recorded Alt/Az angles of Beam 4 (D) where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 We then obtain all other beam vectors from their respective Alt/Az coordinates
 using Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "TelMountBeam"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process for obtaining the beam pointing vectors from C-MIGITS is essentially
 identical to the process above, except that C-MIGITS provides roll, pitch
 and heading.
 It should be noted, as will be addressed later, the C-MIGITS heading is
 not reliable when the device is stationary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the pointing angles of the beams are obtained from the telescope mount
 and C-MIGITS, the pointing angles need to be compared.
 However, the beam vectors are recorded in different coordinate frames and
 C-MIGITS heading data cannot be treated as reliable.
 A transformation matrix between these two frames and heading adjustments
 to C-MIGITS are determined using minimization of errors so we can compare
 the beam pointing results.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:AngleDiff"

\end_inset

 shows the difference in angle between each of the four beams after optimizing
 the transformation between the two coordinate frames.
 The two beam pointing measurements give results that are quite close.

An assessment of the beam pointing accuracy was performed by translating
 the focused beam across the IR card and finding the spread of angles accepted
 by the optical system.
 The full angle field-of-view of the system was approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\prime}$

 or about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.02^{\circ}$

 The beam spot position can be repeated to greater accuracy than this (we
 can see when it is well centered using the CCD), however this is probably
 a reasonable uncertainty figure because the IR card may not be located
 at the exact Fourier plane of the optical system.

\begin_layout Standard
The following uncertainty analysis treats unknown biases in pointing as
 random variables with standard deviations or variances.
 These figures represent uncertainty, not stochastic processes.
 The resultant variances provide bounds on the LAMS wind vector accuracy
 based strictly on the instrument characterization, independent of other
 factors such as signal fidelity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accuracy to which we know the LAMS relative beam pointing directly impacts
 our estimates of airspeed and wind.
 A sequence of line-of-sight velocity measurements are given by the equation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{m}=\mathbf{U}\vec{v}_{L},\label{Vmeas}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{m}$
\end_inset

 is the set of measurements (3 or 4 elements corresponding to the number
 of beams in use), 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{L}$
\end_inset

 is the air velocity vector in the LAMS beam coordinate basis and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix describing each beam's pointing angle given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{U}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\hat{u}_{1} & \hat{u}_{2} & \hat{u}_{3} & \hat{u}_{4}\end{array}\right]^{T},\label{Umatrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $ith$
\end_inset

 beam pointing direction.
 The exact vector entries for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 are dependent on which beams are used for LAMS operation.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}_{4}$
\end_inset

 would not be included for HCR-TEST (post-DEEPWAVE configuration) where
 the down-inboard beam was not used in that three beam configuration.
 For this analysis the beam and air velocity vectors are defined in the
 LAMS relative coordinate frame.
 Though this is not inherently required, it allows the analysis presented
 in this section to flow directly into further uncertainty analysis described
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Absolute"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The covariance matrix of a beam pointing vector is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\hat{u}_{i}}^{2}=\left(\frac{\partial\hat{u}_{i}}{\partial\phi}\right)\sigma_{\phi}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial\hat{u}_{i}}{\partial\phi}\right)^{T}+\left(\frac{\partial\hat{u}_{i}}{\partial\theta}\right)\sigma_{\theta}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial\hat{u}_{i}}{\partial\theta}\right)^{T},\label{CovUvec}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\phi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 are the standard deviation of the beam pointing angles.
 Note that the uncertainty in these angles may be different for each beam,
 but this analysis will treat them as identical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variance in a measurement due to beam pointing uncertainty is given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{m_{ii}}^{2}=\vec{v}_{L}^{T}\Sigma_{\hat{u}_{i}}^{2}\vec{v}_{L}.\label{measUncert}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The uncertainty in the relative pointing angles are assumed to be independent
 for each beam (common uncertainty in the instrument pointing will be addressed
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Absolute"

\end_inset

).
 Thus the total measurement covariance matrix is diagonal and given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\vec{m}}^{2}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\sigma_{m_{11}}^{2} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \sigma_{m_{22}}^{2} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & \sigma_{m_{33}}^{2} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_{m_{44}^{2}}
\end{array}\right].\label{measCov}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total velocity uncertainty in the LAMS coordinate frame is ultimately
 bounded by its covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\vec{v}_{L}}^{2}=\mathbf{U}_{inv}\left(\Sigma_{\vec{m}}^{2}+\Sigma_{f}^{2}+\mathbf{U}\Sigma_{\vec{v}}^{2}\mathbf{U}^{T}\right)\mathbf{U}_{inv},\label{VlamsError}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the velocity uncertainty resulting from beam pointing uncertainty
 is given by the covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{\vec{m}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 from Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "measCov"

\end_inset

, the uncertainty due to FFT Doppler peak estimation is described by the
 covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{f}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and is defined in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:FreqPrec"

\end_inset

, the covariance matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{\vec{v}}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is the result of velocity variability between the three or four beam sample
 volumes with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 being the beam projection matrix from Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "Umatrix"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}_{inv}$
\end_inset

 is the inversion matrix for finding the total velocity vector from the
 three or four line-of-sight measurements.
 In the case of the three beam LAMS, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}_{inv}=\mathbf{U}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 However, because the four beam system is overdefined, a pseudo-inverse
 may be used, or if the uncertainty in measurements are well known, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{U}_{inv}=\left[\mathbf{U}^{T}\left(\Sigma_{L}^{2}\right)^{-1}\mathbf{U}\right]^{-1}\mathbf{U}^{T}\left(\Sigma_{L}^{2}\right)^{-1},\label{OptInv}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{L}^{2}=\Sigma_{\vec{m}}^{2}+\Sigma_{f}^{2}+\mathbf{U}\Sigma_{\vec{v}}^{2}\mathbf{U}^{T}.\label{TotalMeasUncert}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming the angle uncertainty of all four beams is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $0.02^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and an aircraft velocity of 200 m/s along the LAMS pointing direction,
 the total velocity uncertainty resulting from beam pointing uncertainty
 is approximately 0.06 m/s in the horizontal and vertical directions with
 the four beam configuration, 0.09 m/s in the horizontal and vertical directions
 with the three beam configuration used in HCR-TEST.
 To first order approximation, The forward velocity is insensitive to small
 perturbations beam pointing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Add note that C-MIGITS cannot provide reliable heading information without
 moving.
 Heading adjustments had to be added to the fit of the two measurements.

\begin_layout Standard
With the relative pointing angles of the beams, an air velocity vector can
 be retrieved reliably in the predefined LAMS coordinate frame.
 However, the exact transformation between the LAMS beams and the C-MIGITS
 coordinate frame (defined by the unit's principle axes) is unknown.
 We typically assume that one C-MIGITS axis is exactly aligned to the forward
 pointing beam and one is directed along the angle beam 1.
 However, it stands to reason that there will be some slight differences
 between the LAMS beam coordinate frame and the principle axes of the C-MIGITS.
 At present, the only method we have for determining this transformation
 relies on making small angle adjustments based on flight maneuvers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let the transformation matrix between the LAMS relative coordinate frame
 and the C-MIGITS principle axes be 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T_{L}}$
\end_inset

.
 The velocity from LAMS is converted to the C-MIGITS coordinate frame using
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}_{c}=\mathbf{T_{L}}\vec{v}_{L},\label{velL2C}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{c}$
\end_inset

 is the air velocity vector in the C-MIGITS coordinate frame and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{L}$
\end_inset

 the air velocity vector in the LAMS relative beam coordinate frame.
 To propagate error in the transformation matrix we reframe the problem
 by vectorizing the matrix such that Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 becomes 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}_{c}=\mathbf{V_{L}}\vec{t}_{L},\label{velL2Cvect}

\end_inset

where the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T_{L}}$
\end_inset

 has been converted to the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{t}_{L}$

 given by 
\begin_inset Formula

 The matrix

 is constructed from the LAMS coordinate frame velocity vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{L}$

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the

\end_inset

 element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{L}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The covariance matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{t}_{L}$
\end_inset

 can be estimated from the uncertainties in the roll, pitch and yaw transformati
on angles denoted here as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 respectively using partial derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\vec{t}_{L}}^{2}=\left(\frac{\partial\vec{t}_{L}}{\partial\gamma}\right)\sigma_{\gamma}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial\vec{t}_{L}}{\partial\gamma}\right)^{T}+\left(\frac{\partial\vec{t}_{L}}{\partial\beta}\right)\sigma_{\beta}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial\vec{t}_{L}}{\partial\beta}\right)^{T}+\left(\frac{\partial\vec{t}_{L}}{\partial\alpha}\right)\sigma_{\alpha}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial\vec{t}_{L}}{\partial\alpha}\right)^{T}.\label{tCov}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the velocity covariance matrix in the C-MIGITS coordinate frame is
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\vec{v}_{c}}^{2}=\mathbf{V_{L}}\Sigma_{\vec{t}_{L}}^{2}\mathbf{V_{L}}^{T}+\mathbf{T_{L}}\Sigma_{\vec{v}_{L}}^{2}\mathbf{T_{L}}^{T},\label{CMvelError}

\end_inset

 is obtained from Eq.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that a similar analysis can be performed for the transformati

ADD DETAILS ON DETERMINING THIS TRANSFORMATION MATRIX FROM FLIGHT DATA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the C-MIGITS INS, the air velocity measurements can be transformed
 into a global coordinate frame.
 The transformation matrix is determined using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T_{1}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T_{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{T_{3}}$
\end_inset

 from the roll, pitch and yaw reported by C-MIGITS.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LAMS A/D samples each beam detection channel at 200 MHz and performs
 a 1024 point FFT.
 The frequency resolution of the FFT is thus given by the sample rate divided
 by the number of data points 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta f=\dfrac{f_{s}}{N_{s}}=195\mathrm{kHz}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The Doppler shift measured on a particular beam is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f_{D}=\frac{2}{\lambda}\hat{u}\cdot\vec{v},\label{DopplerShift}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the laser wavelength (1560 nm), 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}$
\end_inset

 is the beam direction and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 is the velocity vector of the air relative to the instrument.
 A factor of two is included because the Doppler shift is imposed twice,
 first when the beam is absorbed by the aerosol and second when it is re-emitted.
 Along the beam line-of-sight, each FFT bin corresponds to a velocity resolution
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta v_{LOS}=0.15\mathrm{m/s}$
\end_inset

.
 With post processing the backscatter Doppler peak can be determined at
 sub-bin resolution.
 This is accomplished using linear interpolation on the derivative of the
 backscatter peak to find the derivative zero crossing.
 For the purposes of this analysis, we assume a sub-sample resolution of
 about 0.3, giving a line-of-sight velocity resolution of about 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta v_{LOS}=0.05\mathrm{m/s}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resulting covariance matrix for each line-of-sight velocity measurement
 (only accounting for frequency accuracy) is diagonal with identically distribut
ed variances 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{f}^{2}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\sigma_{v_{LOS}}^{2} & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \sigma_{v_{LOS}}^{2} & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & \sigma_{v_{LOS}}^{2} & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \sigma_{v_{LOS}}^{2}
\end{array}\right],\label{CovFreq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where, for our purposes, we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{v_{LOS}}=\Delta v_{LOS}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis presented here assumes variance in the sample rate to be small
 compared to other error sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that at GV speeds, the Doppler shift is expected to exceed the Nyquist
 frequency at the present sample rate.
 We use the true air speed measurements from the aircraft radome to determine
 which frequency fold contains the Doppler peak.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Flow Distortion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initial operation of the three beam LAMS on IDEAS-4-GV revealed that the
 aircraft can influence flow fields in the LAMS sample volume.
 This issue became recognizable when data processing showed the down-inboard
 beam registered significantly slower velocities than the other two beams.
 An analysis using Gulfstream's computational fluid dynamics analysis confirmed
 that all three beams could be expected to observe some flow distortion.
 The expected flow distortion depends on the aircraft flight parameters.
 The down-inboard beam is expected to experience the largest effect, typically
 observing a line-of-sight flow effect between -0.5 and -2.0 m/s when the
 beam is focused at 20 m.
 The upward beam may see flow effects on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.5$
\end_inset

 m/s and the down-outboard may see flow effects between 0 and -0.5 m/s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the GV, LAMS no longer uses the down-inboard beam due to the substantial
 flow effects in its sample volume.
 The flow effects around the C-130 will be better determined after the ARISTO
 flight campaign in Fall 2015.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Uncertainty arising from separation of measurement volumes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In turbulent conditions the three sensitive volumes can be characterized
 by slightly different values of the wind vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\{u,v,w\}.$
\end_inset

 The single forward beam measures 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 directly while the 3-beam system must solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 using the relative wind measurements at three locations displaced from
 each other.
 If there are variations in the wind vector at these three locations, that
 will introduce an error that can be significantly larger than the measurement
 errors for a single-beam-forward system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If for simplicity it is assumed that the 3-beam system is aligned so that
 the longitudinal axis matches the 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 axis and the vertical axis matches the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 axis, then the unique solution (for a 35
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 diverging-beam angle) for the true airspeed (
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

) is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u=\frac{(a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3})}{3\cos(35^{\circ})}\label{eq:TAS3beam}

If each beam measures relative airspeed in its direction of alignment to
 an uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, then a one-beam system aligned along the airflow measures with uncertainty
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 while a three-beam system measures to uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{3}\delta/(3\cos(35^{\circ})=0.7\delta$
\end_inset

, so if each beam is an independent measurement the 3-beam system measures
 TAS more accurately than a single-beam system.
 However, the unique solution for the wind vector obtained from the 3-beam
 system relies on the assumption that all three beams are viewing air that
 has the same wind vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 If there is variation in the wind vector at the three viewed locations,
 that variation is not necessarily just variation in 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 (that it might be desirable to average) but can also result from other
 variations because the beams are not aligned along the

\end_inset

 axis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the uncertainty 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is less than 0.1 m/s, variations of this magnitude would introduce errors
 comparable to the measurement error.

Schuler correction for pitch

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basis for the correction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before discussing additional aspects of the measurement system like determinatio
n of sensitivity coefficients for the radome, it is necessary to explain
 and document a correction that will be used in that determination and in
 subsequent studies.
 The normal primary weakness in measurement of vertical wind is the measurement
 of pitch, which is provided only by inertial reference systems and therefore
 has the uncertainty and fluctuations associated with those systems.
 An inertial system aligns during initialization to detect the local vertical
 direction and then calculates the new vertical direction as the aircraft
 moves (changing the local vertical direction) and accelerates (which can
 cause gyros to precess).
 Any misalignment present at initialization persists but also can oscillate
 and can cause errors in roll and pitch to mix as the aircraft changes flight
 direction.
 The standard error associated with this measurement is 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 for flight duration of a few hours, and the error often increases during
 the flight as heading errors and accelerometer biases affect the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the work of Schuler (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Schuler1923"

\end_inset

), coupling among some of these error sources leads to limits on the growth
 of errors and simultaneous oscillations in some of the measurement errors.
 In particular, an error in pitch leads to an error in horizontal acceleration,
 and integration of that error in horizontal acceleration leads to a position
 error that compensates for the original error in pitch.
 However, when the error in pitch is reduced to zero, errors in position
 and velocity have been accumulated and those lead to growth of the error
 in pitch in the direction opposite to the original error.
 The result is a Schuler oscillation having a period of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{Sch}=(R_{e}/g)^{0.5}/(2\pi)\approx5064\thinspace s$
\end_inset

 or 84.4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

min, where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{e}$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the Earth and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 the acceleration of gravity.
 The existence of this coupling allows estimation of the pitch error if
 the error in horizontal acceleration is known.
 That is the case in DEEPWAVE because high-quality measurements of velocity
 are available from GPS and those measurements can be compared to the uncorrecte
d measurements from the inertial systems to measure the error in velocity
 and, from its derivative, the error in acceleration.
 The specified uncertainty for the IRU, 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, contributes an uncertainty in measured vertical wind of about 0.2 m/s,
 and it is shown later that this is the dominant contribution to uncertainty
 in that measurement, so improving on this can lead to significant reduction
 in the uncertainty associated with measurement of vertical wind.

The result is that this erroneous acceleration produces a false northward
 velocity and, integrated, a northward error in position.
 However, the error then causes the integrated position to become too far
 north, where the calculated direction toward the center of the earth becomes
 biased in the opposite direction, and at some point the calculated offset
 from being too far north equals the pitch bias, as shown in the next figure:

However, at the point where the error in latitude cancels the error in pitch,
 there is an accumulated error in velocity, so the integrated solution for
 position overshoots the equilibrium position by an amount such that the
 error in pitch becomes the negative of the original error, at which point
 the integrated velocity is zero but the new error in pitch now causes a
 reversal of the position error.
 The result is that the errors in pitch, velocity and position all oscillate

The key to developing a correction to the pitch angle is that both 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta v_{n}$
\end_inset

 are observable because reference measurements are available from GPS.
 For example,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta x_{n} & = & R_{e}(\mathrm{LAT-GGLAT)}\nonumber \\
\delta v_{n} & = & \mathrm{VNS-GGVNS}\label{eq:observed-errors}
\end{eqnarray}

These observations can determine 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{n}$
\end_inset

 in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:delta-vn-solution"

\end_inset

 From these, the error in pitch can be found from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:delta-vn-dot"

\end_inset

):
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\theta=-\frac{1}{g}\frac{d(V_{n}\cos(\omega t+\zeta_{n})}{dt}=\frac{V_{n}\omega}{g}\sin(\omega t+\zeta_{n})\label{eq:solution-delta-theta}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Analogous equations lead to a similar coupling between the roll angle and
 the east component of the ground velocity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\phi=\frac{V_{e}\omega}{g}\sin(\omega t+\zeta_{e})\label{eq:solution-delta-phi}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is the roll angle and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{e}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta_{e}$
\end_inset

 are determined from fits to the observed error 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta v_{e}=\mathrm{VEW-GGVEW}$

 to sine or cosine functions, it is possible to obtain an estimate of the

) or (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It is important to note, though, that this gives errors in the local reference
 frame with axes eastward, northward, and upward, here called the l-frame,
 and these errors will then need to be transformed to the aircraft reference
 frame to get errors in the measured quantities.
 The choice made here is to estimate the derivatives using Savitzky-Golay
 polynomials, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Savitzky-Golay-estimates"

 Savitzky-Golay polynomials were chosen because they are computationally
 efficient, don't introduce a time shift, and can provide derivatives directly.
 A rather long averaging period of 1009 s, or about 1/5 of a Schuler oscillation
, was used to reduce noise in the result, and interpolation filled some
 gaps in the measurements.

Transformation of attitude angles

\begin_layout Standard
In a reference frame called the 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame or ENU frame, where the coordinate axes are local-east, local-north,
 and upward, the preceding section showed that the pitch and roll errors
 are related, via (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:delta-theta"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:delta-phi"

\end_inset

), to the time-derivatives of the errors in horizontal velocity.
 Pitch and roll as used in these equations will be the respective errors
 in platform alignment
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The inertial system used is a strap-down system, so there is no actual motion
 of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

platform
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Instead, from measured rotations and accelerations, the system calculates
 the expected orientation if there were a true stabilized platform.
 The errors referenced here are those relative to that calculated platform
 orientation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the north-south and east-west directions, so these angles must be transforme
d to account for the orientation of the aircraft when it is not flying straight-
and-level to the north.
 Coordinates in the body or 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

-frame of the aircraft are obtained from those in the ENU or 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame by applying three rotations to account for the heading, pitch, and
 roll of the 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

-frame.
 This transformation leads to pitch errors in the body frame of the aircraft
 (where measured pitch and roll are measured and where the pitch measurement
 affects the calculated vertical wind) that are mixtures of pitch and roll
 errors in the 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame, with the mixture dependent primarily on the heading.
 A positive pitch error for northbound level flight will be a negative pitch
 error for southbound level flight, and for eastbound flight an 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame roll error becomes a 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

-frame pitch error while an 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame pitch error become a negative 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

-frame roll error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a unit vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{(l)}$
\end_inset

 representing the orientation errors in pitch and roll in the 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame, with components {
\begin_inset Formula $\sin\delta\phi,\,\sin\delta\theta,\,\sqrt{1-\sin^{2}\delta\phi-\sin^{2}\delta\theta}$
\end_inset

} or, because the errors are always small, approximately {
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\phi,\,\delta\theta,\,1$
\end_inset

}.
 The three-angle transformation of this vector from the 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-frame to the 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

-frame is then represented by the following matrices, with {
\begin_inset Formula $\phi,\,\theta,\,\psi$
\end_inset

} denoting {roll, pitch, heading}:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{l}^{b}=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\psi\cos\phi+\sin\psi\sin\phi\sin\theta & -\sin\psi\cos\phi+\cos\psi\sin\phi\sin\theta & -\cos\theta\sin\phi\\
\sin\psi\cos\theta & \cos\psi\cos\theta & \sin\theta\\
\cos\psi\sin\phi-\sin\psi\sin\theta\cos\phi & -\sin\psi\sin\phi-\cos\psi\sin\theta\sin\phi & \cos\theta\cos\phi
\end{bmatrix}\label{eq:transform-l-to-b}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

If the roll and pitch angles are small,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{b^{(b)}=}R_{l}^{b}\mathbf{b^{(l)}} & \approx & \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\cos\psi & -\sin\psi & 0\\
\sin\psi & \cos\psi & 0\\

\end{array}\right]\begin{bmatrix}\delta\phi\\
\delta\theta\\

\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\cos\psi\delta\phi-\sin\psi\delta\theta\\
\sin\psi\delta\phi+\cos\psi\delta\theta\\
1
\end{bmatrix}\label{eq:b-vector-in-b-frame}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
which leads to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\theta^{(b)}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\phi^{(b)}$
\end_inset

, the pitch and roll errors in the 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

-frame:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta\theta^{(b)} & \simeq & \sin\psi\delta\phi+\cos\psi\delta\theta\label{eq:final-answer}\\
\delta\phi^{(b)} & \approx & \cos\psi\delta\phi-\sin\psi\delta\theta\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

In turns, the roll angle is no longer negligible, so in general the full
 transformation matrix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:transform-l-to-b"

\end_inset

 should be used.
 Because this matrix imposes rotations by the measured pitch and roll angles,
 the unit vector representing the errors in pitch and roll after transformation
 will have components from which the true pitch and roll can be determined,
 so subtracting the corrected pitch from the measured pitch gives the error
 in measured pitch: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta\theta^{(b)}=\theta-\arctan\frac{b_{2}^{(b)}}{b_{3}^{(b)}}\label{eq:pitch-error-wo-approx}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This pitch error should then be subtracted from the measured pitch to obtain
 a corrected value of the pitch for use in the calculation of vertical wind.

\begin_layout Subsection
Application to research flights
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The research flights have frequent changes in heading, with mixing of the
 roll and pitch errors but also accelerations that affect those errors and
 introduction of new errors from heading errors.
 The corrections to pitch therefore appear much less systematic than was
 the case for the ferry flight.
 An example, DEEPWAVE flight 1, is presented here.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:processing-1"

\end_inset

 shows the measured errors in ground-speed components, and Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:processing-2"

\end_inset

 shows the deduced pitch and roll errors.
 There are instances where the pitch error abruptly reverses sign; those
 are cases where the flight direction changes by about 180 deg.
 During turns, the full transformation leads to a result significantly different
 from the small-angle-approximation result, as shown by the orange line
 in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:processing-2"

\end_inset

, but when not turning the full-transformation results replicate the small-angle
-approximation results (blue line), as indicated by the orange dashed line
 overlapping the blue line.
 The proposed solution is to use the full transformation for processing
 a corrected pitch variable, to be named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PITCHC
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to be used for calculation of the vertical wind.
 In straight-and-level flight, the needed corrections are about 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

0.03
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 at some times, and this error can lead (for true airspeed of 220 m/s) to
 an error in vertical wind of about 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.1$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 Correction for this error thus should lead to a significant reduction in
 the uncertainty associated with the measured vertical wind.

\begin_layout Subsection
Tests of the correction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two tests were used to test if these pitch corrections made any significant
 difference in the measurements of vertical wind.
 First, wind measurements made before and after level course reversal were
 compared to see if correcting the pitch reduces the difference in measurements
 on the two legs before and after turns.
 Reduction would be expected because if there is a pitch error it would
 reverse sign between the two legs, increasing their absolute difference.
 Second, flight-average and project-average vertical wind measurements were
 compiled without and with the pitch correction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is a tabulation of five instances where the flight track reversed
 course and remained at the same altitude.
 A number of other candidates were excluded because conditions were too
 variable along the legs to produce a small-uncertainty estimate of the
 vertical wind.
 In each case, flight periods of about 5 min (sometimes adjusted in times
 of strong wind to give similar-length segments flown upwind and downwind)
 are listed before and after the turn, but excluding the turn, to represent
 approximately overlapping flight segments where it would be expected that
 the vertical wind would be the same.

 More significant that this reduction is that the values were so small even

The average vertical wind for each flight, before and after application

 The data restriction applied was that the true airspeed be above 130

 project).
 Flights 6, 7, and 15 are also missing, as explained in the text.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mean value of the vertical wind, for all flights combined, was 0.03
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s for the uncorrected measurements and 0.02
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s for the corrected measurements, with standard deviations of 0.06
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, so both are well within expected tolerances.
 The pitch correction has little effect on these mean measurements or the
 overall standard deviation.
 However, the small offset obtained with the pitch corrections applied does
 not indicate that the measurements are only uncertain within these limits,
 because most flights are long compared to the Schuler-oscillation period
 of about 84 min.
 Flights will average over an oscillating correction and that average may
 be small compared to the correction applied.
 The standard deviation of the applied correction is 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 when calculated for the entire project.
 That indicates that the correction to vertical wind arising from application
 of the pitch-correction algorithm introduces changes with standard deviation
 of about 0.09
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

 project-wide.
 Studies of individual flights show that this varies significantly from
 flight to flight.
 This uncertainty, however, is a significant contributor to the uncertainty
 in vertical wind.
 Without pitch correction, measurements of vertical wind will have an error
 with typical period of the Schuler oscillation that, for measurements spanning
 much shorter periods, will appear as a slowly varying bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The correction procedure developed here is not suited to application during
 normal processing of data files because it uses a fit to the entire sequence
 of ground-speed measurements to find the corrections while the normal processor
 is sequential.
 An R script has been developed to add values of pitch and vertical wind
 after correction, but this must be run after the original file is generated.
 The correction only applies to the Honeywell IRUs; The C-MIGITSIII units
 already incorporate Kalman feedback from a GPS signal and so already apply
 a correction similar to the one applied here.

sensitivity coefficients
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that provide parameterized measurements of the angles of the relative wind
 (angle of attack and sideslip angle) in terms of measured quantities like

 These sensitivity coefficients are essential for measurement of the relative
 wind, as described in Sect.

 DEEPWAVE Flight RF15 on 3 July 2014 was devoted to calibration maneuvers,
 and measurements from that flight, combined with similar calibration maneuvers
 flown on RF11 at 40,000 ft, are used to determine sensitivity coefficients
 for angle of attack (AKRD and AK_GP) and for sideslip (SSRD and SS_GP).
 A larger data set, described below, is also used to study the representativenes
s and uncertainty of the resulting sensitivity coefficients.
 This section also discusses some aspects of the relative timing of the
 measurements.

The first-order expression for the vertical wind 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w=V\sin(\alpha-\phi)+w_{p}\label{eq:VWind}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is the true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 the angle of attack, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 the pitch, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 the vertical motion or rate-of-climb of the aircraft.
 The solution for the angle-of-attack is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha=\phi+\arcsin\frac{w-w_{p}}{V}\label{eq:SolvedForAOA}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If it is reasonable to assume for some period of flight that 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is zero, or that it averages to zero, then
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{*}=\phi-\arcsin\frac{w_{p}}{V}\label{eq:alphaWithwZero}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
can be used as a reference angle-of-attack to which to fit a parameterized
 formula.
 This fit reference depends on measurements of pitch, rate-of-climb, and
 true airspeed.
 Even in the presence of waves, fitting functions of the radome measurements
 and other flight characteristics to this reference should average any real
 effects of vertical wind as long as the vertical wind over the flight segments
 used averages to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The danger in this approach is that a particular data set may not have negligibl
e average mean wind.
 For example, if a flight spent more time in the updraft regions in the
 ascending portion upwind of the island and less in the downdraft region
 downwind of the island, the mean measurement of vertical wind may not be
 negligible.
 The functions used for representation of angle of attack always include
 an offset term along with functions of measurements, so it may be appropriate
 to adjust that offset if there is evidence that the mean vertical wind
 should not be zero.
 Other steps can be taken to check that offset coefficient, as discussed
 in subsequent sections.
 One compromise, followed below, is to determine any coefficients other
 than the offset term from comprehensive data sets but then revised the
 constant coefficient in the fit on the basis of special periods expected
 to average to zero vertical wind, like flight over the ocean well away
 from weather disturbances or special calibration flights in conditions
 with apparently level air motions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the radome, the relevant variables are 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

=PITCH, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}=$
\end_inset

GGVSPD, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V=$
\end_inset

TASX.
 The radome measures the pressure difference (ADIFR) between top and bottom
 ports on the radome, and this pressure is usually normalized by some measure
 of dynamic pressure like QCF or QCXC or QCRC.
 The former is preferable because the use of corrected QCXC requires the
 application of static-defect corrections that themselves depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, leading to circularity in the calculation, and QCR and QCRC are sometimes
 affected by icing or freezing of accumulated water even when ADIFR continues
 to function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the gust pod, the relevant variables are 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

=CPITCH_GP, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

=CVSPD_GP, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

=TASX.
 The gust-pod measurements differ from those measured relative to the fuselage;
 for example, the pitch of the gust pod is several degrees different from
 that of the fuselage because of the way in which the gust-pod IRU is installed.
 However, the true airspeed 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:alphaWithwZero"

\end_inset

) is measured better by the fuselage system, so TASX will be used for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 The equation with the appropriate variables is then: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{*}=\mathrm{CPITCH\_GP}-\arcsin\frac{\mathrm{CVSPD\_GP}}{\mathrm{TASX}}\label{eq:AOAeq}
\end{equation}

\begin_layout Standard

Calibration
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of the angle-of-attack (i.e., determining the sensitivity coefficients) then
 requires determining a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\{x_{i}\})$
\end_inset

 of measured quantities that matches 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{*}$
\end_inset

 determined from (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AOAeq"

\end_inset

).
 Possible terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 in that function may include ADIFR and related measurements of pressure
 and dynamic pressure as well as Mach number, and powers and products of
 these terms.
 For the Rosemount 858 sensor used with the gust pod, it is expected from
 theory that one element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 will be ADIF_GP/QC_GP.
 Wind tunnel and theoretical studies predict how the pressure will vary
 on a hemispheric surface with changing angles, but those don't necessarily
 apply to the mounting location on the GV because there is considerable
 flow distortion at the under-wing location of the pod and that affects
 the pressure response to changes in flow angles.
 Therefore, the best approach is to use the above approach for that sensor
 also and determine a functional response that matches the calibration data.

The best method for calibrating angle-of-attack is through the use of speed
 runs.
 In this maneuver, the aircraft is slowed to a speed near the lower range
 of its operating range, then accelerated to near the upper limit, and then
 slowed again to normal cruise.
 If this is done while flying a level track, the angle of attack will vary
 through its normal range and the pitch will vary similarly.
 If there is no vertical wind or if a fluctuating vertical wind averages
 to zero, (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:alphaWithwZero"

\end_inset

) then can be used to provide a reference angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha^{*}$
\end_inset

 that serves as reference for the parameterized fit.
 There were three speed runs during RF15, at the times 3:21--3:29, 4:15--4:23,
 and 5:01--5:11 UTC.
 On RF11, there was a similar speed run flown from 10:30--10:40.
 For the purpose of this first determination of sensitivity coefficients
 for angle-of-attack, only those periods were used.
 In addition, because some of the measurements at minimum speed deviated
 from the otherwise simple fits, only measurements with true airspeed in
 excess of 130 m/s were used; this eliminated some of the slowest parts
 of the speed runs, but that is a flight speed not used in normal operation.

The sensitivity to the pressure difference between vertically separated
 ports is the most important part of the calibration of angle of attack.
 Secondary terms are sometimes needed to adjust the value to maintain a
 correct zero.
 Therefore, the fit was done in two stages.
 First, the four speed runs alone were used to determine the sensitivity
 to the pressure ratio, and then a larger dataset was used to incorporate
 a wider range of flight conditions to check that the fit determined from
 the speed runs remained representative of the larger data set..
 The first fit was to the following simplified equation:

 The fit accounted for 97.9% of the variance and had a residual standard

, the thin gray line under the thick orange dashed line represents the uncertain
ty in the fit result and shows that the uncertainty in representing these
 data with this set of coefficients is negligible.
 The more significant uncertainty, however, comes from the assumption that
 the vertical wind is zero for these periods of the speed runs.
 Therefore, additional studies will be used below for further evaluation
 of the uncertainty introduced by this assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This calibration would be affected by a time difference between the IRU
 measurement of pitch and the data-system sampling of the pressures involved,
 especially that from the radome.
 The IRU outputs measurements with a time delay that can be variable and
 unknown but is expected to be <0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s, and normal processing uses an adjustment of 60
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

ms to compensate for this delay.
 To guard against this delay affecting the calibration, fits like that leading
 to the above formula and coefficients were repeated after shifting the
 measurement of pitch by various time intervals, both forward and backward.
 For shifts within about 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s, the results did not change significantly, although the fit with adjustment
 of pitch 
\emph on
backward
\emph default
 by about 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s had the smallest standard error .
 Equivalently, a similar standard error was obtained if the measurement
 of the pressure ratio from the radome (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

) were moved forward in time by a similar amount.
 Neither of these shifts seems likely at this magnitude, and the change
 in standard error was only about 0.002
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so we interpret this as indicating insensitivity of the calibration to
 small shifts in time.
 That is likely a result of the calibration data being from speed runs where
 the flight speed is gradually increased and then decreased, so any effect
 of a lag partially cancels in such data segments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calibration would also be affected by pitch errors such as are discussed
 in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Schuler"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore the correction procedure discussed in that section was applied
 to these data before finding the preceding fit.
 In comparison to the fit without this correction, the standard error was
 changed only negligibly and the two fit coefficients changed by -0.007 and
 -0.004, respectively, so this correction also had only minor effect on the
 fit, with changes comparable to or smaller than the standard errors in
 these coefficients.
 This insensitivity perhaps arises because the period of the calibration
 spanned a few hours and so included enough time for the Schuler oscillation
 of pitch to average over the dataset used for calibration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Previous studies of the radome where low-altitude flight segments were included
 indicated that an additional term was needed in the calibration to adjust
 the zero for vertical wind for flight in the boundary layer over the ocean.
 The standard calibration determined in that way is that given in the RAF
 document on

with coefficients {
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\prime}$

 The last term provides some adjustment dependent on Mach number and corrects
 an offset often seen in vertical wind at low airspeed.

 The standard calibration is close close to that determined from the speed

 from 0.12

 The difference is most evident for measurements at large angle-of-attack,
 where the standard coefficients produce increasingly higher values as the
 angle-of-attack increases.

Because the standard fit in use for the GV include an additional terms represent
ing dependence on Mach number, the benefit of using such a fit for DEEPWAVE
 is worth considering.
 The primary reason for that fit has been that otherwise the measurements

 flight data from DEEPWAVE was at intermediate or high levels so this may
 not be a concern for this project.

 would represent the angle-of-attack in conditions with non-zero vertical

 For example, including "PITCH" as a term in the fit resulted in a coefficient
 for this term of about 0.4, and such a large correlation between resulting
 measurements of angle-of-attack and pitch would bias the response to a
 true vertical wind.
 As an extreme example, inclusion of a term based on the right side of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $c_{0},\,c_{1}$

} = {4.468, 21.481} and a standard error of 0.12 for 17,715 measurements.
 The small increase in standard error in comparison to the speed-run measurement
s is expected because this expanded data set includes regions more likely
 to have non-zero vertical wind, which contributes to this error.
 Expanding this fit to include a third coefficient as in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

This simpler representation applies to the normal research flight levels
 of the DEEPWAVE project, levels above about 10,000 ft.
 Because expanded representations were needed in other projects to represent
 low-level flight data, and low levels are not included in this expended
 data set, it may be necessary to revisit this calibration with more terms
 if lower-level flight segments are to be analyzed.
\end_layout

 Another fit considered with this expanded data set was to set the slope
 parameter to the value obtained from the speed-run data, 20.986, and then
 fit using the expanded data set to determine a value of the offset coefficient
 that minimized the mean vertical wind.
 That gave a value for the first coefficient of 4.43 and a standard error
 negligibly different from that for the two-coefficient fit, so that is
 another indication that the speed-run dataset and the expanded dataset
 give consistent results.

\begin_layout Standard
The standard errors in the coefficients for the expanded dataset are respectivel
y 0.0035 and 0.046, so the coefficients are tightly constrained by the fit.
 The correlation between error terms was very high and positive, but the
 second coefficient is applied to a term (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p_{\alpha}/q$
\end_inset

 that is typically negative with representative magnitude of about -0.0037
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 so the correlated uncertainties partially cancel, leaving a net uncertainty
 in angle of attack of 0.0007
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 (for 0.99 correlation between the uncertainty terms) as a result of uncertainty
 in the fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expanded dataset provided results consistent with those from the speed
 runs alone but contained 17,721 measurements vs.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

only 2,019 for the speed-run dataset, so this larger set provides an opportunity
 to examine the consistency of results from subsets of the measurements.
 For this purpose, randomly selected but exclusive subsets of the data were
 selected repeatedly and the fit coefficients were determined from each
 of these subsets.
 In one example, the dataset was divided randomly into 100 exclusive subsets
 and the fit coefficients were calculated for each of those subsets, and
 then this process was repeated 50 times.
 The resulting standard deviations in the fit coefficients were 0.070 and
 0.88.
 With resampling, the independent samples entering these averages are fewer
 than 5000 but more than 100, suggesting that the means for the coefficients
 are known with uncertainties of between 0.007 -- 0.001 for the first coefficient
 and 0.09--0.012 for the second.
 The estimates from the fit (0.004, 0.053) are midway in these ranges, so
 the fit results are consistent when the data are partitioned into various
 subsets.
 The fit results thus appear reasonably characterized by the estimated standard
 errors from the fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repeating this for different subset sizes 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 indicated that the standard deviations in the coefficients scaled in a
 manner consistent with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{N}$
\end_inset

 behavior, suggesting that the results are not biased by isolated outlier
 measurements such as would occur from regions of extended non-zero vertical
 wind.
 The subsetting also produced resulting values for the individual coefficients
 that were highly correlated, with correlation coefficient around 0.99.
 This also supports the partial cancellation of uncertainty as evaluated
 for the fits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These estimates of uncertainty characterize how well the sensitivity coefficient
s characterize the data, but the validity of the result is dependent on
 the mean vertical wind being zero, as discussed in connection with Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:SolvedForAOA"

\end_inset

).
 A non-zero mean vertical wind of 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s will introduce bias into the first sensitivity coefficient of magnitude
 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, a value much larger than the estimated uncertainty in angle of attack
 resulting from the fit.
 This then is the major uncertainty affecting angle of attack and hence
 vertical wind, and it is difficult to quantify except by estimates of how
 large the vertical wind might be.
 For all 1-s measurements of vertical wind in the DEEPWAVE project, the
 mean vertical wind was 0.03
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s without correction for pitch errors and <0.01
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s with such correction, in both cases with a standard deviation of about
 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 When measurements are partitioned into groups within 1-5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 longitude upwind and downwind of the island crest, using a slanted dividing
 line approximately matching the orientation of the island, the two groups
 had respective mean vertical wind measurements of -0.026 and +0.032
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, so even over the South Island of New Zealand there was no significant
 mean vertical wind at the altitude of research flights.
 It therefore seems reasonable to use a limit of about 0.05
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s as applicable to the calibration process, and so a bias limit on the
 first sensitivity coefficient of magnitude 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 This is then the dominant uncertainty component entering the measurement
 of angle of attack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One additional test was used to check the consistency of the measurements
 and to ensure that the project-mean vertical wind would be near zero for
 research-flight conditions.
 All flights that appeared to provide good data for the calibration procedure
 were combined into one dataset.
 The excluded flights were 6 and 7 (where there were problems with plugged
 lines in the radome), and 15 (the calibration flight, mostly at lower than
 research flight altitude).
 Also, the period from 9:50 to 10:30 UTC on flight 23 was excluded because
 the radome measurements looked suspicious and might have been affected
 by blockage.
 Pitch corrections as discussed in the preceding section were applied to
 these flights, and then the following tests were used to exclude periods
 not significant for the calibration: a) measurements where the true airspeed
 was less than 130 m/s, to exclude periods of anomalously high angle-of-attack,
 esp.
 during takeoff and landing when flaps and/or landing gear might be deployed;
 (b) periods when the roll angle was less than -5 or more than +5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, to exclude turns; and (c) periods of flight below 35,000 ft pressure altitude,
 to emphasize the altitudes most used during research flights.
 More than 400,000 measurements were available for the fit after these exclusion
s.

 These coefficients are similar to those determined for the subset data
 used previously, but they could be used instead if the goal is to minimize
 the offsets in mean vertical wind for the project because, for the constraints
 used, they will force a project-mean vertical wind of 0.
 A test of these coefficients for the segment of flight 12 away from the
 influence of South Island indeed led to a mean wind very close to zero,
 and flight-by-flight averages also are reasonably small with these coefficients.

 In most cases, this was because the CMIGITS IRU providing gust-pod measurements
 of pitch seemed to have larger than normal deviations that appeared suspicious,

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Equations underlying the calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calibration of the sideslip angle is more difficult, both because the equations
 are more complicated and because the maneuver is very hard to fly.
 Ideally, the sideslip maneuver should only change yaw angle and heading
 without change in roll, altitude, or angle-of-attack, but that is impossible
 to fly.
 It is practical, however, to minimize roll and change in altitude, and
 that was how these maneuvers were flown.
 The three sets of yaw maneuvers were at these times: 3:32:00--3:35:30,
 4:31:00--4:33:30, and 5:26:40--5:29:30 UTC.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because the yaw maneuvers on rf11 (10:25:00 to 10:30:00) were flown less
 well, they were not combined with these new measurements, but it does not
 appear that the sideslip calibration has any significant dependence on
 altitude.
\end_layout

\end_inset

In the case of yaw maneuvers, the calibration is based on the expectation
 that the horizontal wind remains constant.
 The first-order equations for the east and north components of the wind,
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
u & = & -U_{a}\sin(\Psi+\beta)+u_{p}\nonumber \\
v & = & -U_{a}\cos(\Psi+\beta)+v_{p}\label{eq:horizWindeqs}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 the heading, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 the sideslip angle, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{p}$
\end_inset

 are the eastward and northward ground-speed components of the aircraft.
 These two equations lead to the following reference formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta^{*}=-\Psi+\arctan\left(\frac{u_{p}-u}{v_{p}-v}\right)\label{eq:beta-equation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the second term represents a correction for the change in direction
 of motion of the aircraft, which is difficult to avoid in the yaw maneuver.
 The measurements thus provide 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$
\end_inset

, an estimate of the sideslip during the yaw maneuvers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is, however, a circular component in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta-equation"

\end_inset

) because it involves the wind components and those require 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for their measurement when sideslip changes.
 To reduce the feedback from this term, the horizontal wind components 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 were low-pass-filtered with periods ranging from 5--60 s and the filtered
 values were used in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta-equation"

\end_inset

).
 Filtering made small differences in the fit coefficients but increased
 the residual error significantly, but 60-s filtering was still selected
 because that is a period long in comparison to the yaw maneuvers so it
 should reduce possible bias in the fit coefficients from use of the older
 sensitivity coefficients and any associated fluctuations in the wind measuremen
ts during maneuvers.

The standard calibration in use for the GV has coefficient

=21.155, so this fit has slope about 5% greater than the standard values.
 These maneuvers were flown with special care to minimize altitude and roll
 changes, so this value may be preferable to the older values.
 The standard error of the fit, about 0.1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, is likely much larger than the error in representing the values of sideslip
 via 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

 because much of the variability likely arises from real fluctuations in
 the horizontal wind, which would contribute this magnitude error for wind
 fluctuations of only about 0.4

m/s.
 The respective uncertainties in the fit coefficients were about 0.005 and
 0.17

 of 0.17/22.3 or less than 1% in the value of the sideslip.
 Measurements of sideslip are seldom larger than 0.2
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 The bias in sideslip is intertwined with possible bias in heading, so further
 study of this offset will be deferred to Section

An additional study is needed to separate a possible offset in sideslip
 from a similar error in heading, because the approach used here assumes
 that the heading is accurate.
 In the data files used for this study, an offset in heading of -0.08
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 was imposed; without that offset, the offset in sideslip (coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{0}$

) would be reduced by 0.08.
 A method of determining these separate offsets is developed later in this
 report (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), where a set of circles flown with constant roll angle are used to obtain

subsection*{The Components of the Relative Wind}% % The gust pod is a new
 wind-sensing system so it is useful to document how the measurements are
 handled.
 The probe itself has five pressure-sensing holes located on a hemispheric
 cap pointed into the wind.
 The pressure difference between the two ports located upward and downward
 from centerline, measured as ADIF
\backslash
_GP, is used in the calculation of angle-of-attack.
 The similar pressure difference between the two ports located toward starboard
 and toward port of centerline, measured as BDIF
\backslash
_GP, are used in the calculation of sideslip.
 In addition, the probe has static ports located on the side of the cylinder
 carrying the hemispheric cap, and the difference between the pressure at
 the forward port and that at the static ports is measured as the dynamic
 pressure QC
\backslash
_GP.
 The static pressure is also measured, as PS
\backslash
_GP.% % In addition, there is an inertial reference unit mounted with the
 gust pod to measure its attitude angles (roll, pitch, heading) and to measure
 the three components of motion of the aircraft relative to the Earth.
 This unit receives GPS information and uses it to update its measurements
 via a Kalman filter.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurements ADIF_GP and BDIF_GP, normalized by QC_GP, are used with
 the calibrations in the preceding section to find the angle-of-attack and
 sideslip.
 In addition, to find the relative wind, a measurement of true airspeed
 (TAS) is needed.
 In an effort to allow the gust-pod system to operate independently of the
 standard radome-based system, it is desirable to determine the true airspeed
 directly from the gust-pod measurements.
 However, the standard system has been calibrated to low uncertainty by
 reference to the Laser Air Motion Sensor, so for the purpose of calibration
 that true airspeed (TASX) will be used as a reference.
 Once the gust-pod measurement of true airspeed is calibrated, the gust-pod
 system still measures wind without future reference to the standard system,
 but the calibration process links the two systems to have a common reference
 for TAS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, the next step needed to use the gust pod wind-sensing system
 is to determine a functional relationship between gust-pod measurements
 and the true airspeed.
 The approach taken is to fit the basic pressure ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $q/p$
\end_inset

 as measured by the 858 probe to match the corresponding pressure ratio
 provided by the conventional measurements of dynamic and static pressure.
 The relationship represents the true ratio of dynamic to static pressure,
 so using that ratio the normal calculation of true airspeed can be used
 to determine the TAS measured by the gust pod.
 For this purpose, all the measurements from the calibration flight (RF15)
 were used qualified only by requiring TASX>130 m/s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurements entering the resulting fit are as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

=QCXC is the reference dynamic pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $p=$
\end_inset

PSXC is the reference ambient pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{g}=$
\end_inset

QC_GP is the gust-pod dynamic pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{g}$
\end_inset

=PS_GP is the gust-pod static pressure, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the Mach number determined from the reference measurements, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{g}$
\end_inset

 the Mach number determined from the gust-pod static and dynamic pressure,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta P_{\alpha,g}$
\end_inset

=ADIF_GP is the pressure difference between top and bottom pressure ports
 on the gust-pod sensor.
 The following equation was found to provide a useful representation of
 the reference ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $q/p$
\end_inset

 in terms of quantities measured only by the gust-probe system:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{q}{p}=b_{0}+b_{1}\frac{q_{g}}{p_{g}}+b_{2}M_{G}\frac{q_{g}}{p_{g}}+b{}_{3}\left(\frac{q_{g}}{p_{g}}\right)^{2}+b_{4}\frac{\Delta p_{\alpha,g}}{q_{g}}+b_{5}M_{G}+b_{6}\left(\frac{\Delta p_{\alpha,g}}{q_{g}}\right)^{2}+b_{7}\frac{\Delta p_{\alpha,g}}{q_{g}}M_{G}\label{eq:TASfit}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This complexity in the equation was needed to obtain a good fit (with residual
 error translating to a typical error in true airspeed of about 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s for typical DEEPWAVE research legs), and all terms were indicated to
 be significant in the fit.

.
 The fit provides a reasonable representation of TASX, with a standard error
 of about 0.4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 This is not much larger than the estimated uncertainty in TASX (about 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s), so wind calculations might be based on this value if necessary.
 However, there is serious danger of over-fitting with this many coefficients
 and variables, even though the fit was improved significantly with each
 addition; indeed, the standard error in the 
\begin_inset Formula $q/p$
\end_inset

 fit was reduced by 50% with the addition of the last two variables in the
 fit.
 Because of the danger that this variable might not perform as well when
 used outside the range of this fit (which was TASX > 130, |ROLL| < 5, and
 GGALT > 5000), it still should be better to base wind measurements from
 the gust pod on the conventional TASX combined with the relative-wind angles
 from the gust pod.
 However, if it is desirable to have a wind measurement that is completely
 independent of the standard radome-based system, using true airspeed measured
 with this fit might provide a useful alternative.

\begin_layout Standard
The standard vertical wind calculation depends on a measurement of vertical
 motion of the aircraft.
 Past projects have used one of VSPD (from the IRU), VSPD_G or GGVSPD (from
 the GPS) or, much earlier, WP3 from a baro-inertial update loop using VSPD.
 This updating is no longer used because the Honeywell IRU providing VSPD
 already incorporates such updating.
 For the systems based on the gust pod or LAMS, additional vertical-velocity
 measurements are provided by their pod-mounted IRUs, respectively CVSPD_GP
 and CVSPD_LAMS.
 Changing roll of the aircraft can cause these measurements to differ from
 the fuselage-based measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because VSPD as provided by the Honeywell IRU is controlled against the
 known instability of IRU measurements in the vertical by updating to a
 reference value provided by pressure altitude, it has some drawbacks.
 Pressure altitude is not really a measure of altitude but of pressure,
 so the reference altitude can be biased.
 Also, the IRU-imposed baro-inertial loop has unknown response characteristics
 and uncertainty, and the value provided by the IRU has inherent filtering.
 The advantage of an IRU variable over a GPS measurement has been, until
 recently, better response at high frequency at the expense of absolute
 accuracy.
 GPS measurements have now improved, esp.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

with OmniSTAR, so it is worth considering what variable or combination of
 variables should be used in the calculation of vertical wind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For horizontal wind, the standard solution in use since the early 1990s
 has been a complementary-filter solution (discussed in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:comp-filter"

\end_inset

, where the difference between IRU and GPS measurements is low-pass filtered
 and the result is added to the IRU measurement.
 This preserves the high-frequency response of the IRU measurement but causes
 the low-frequency components to match the GPS measurements, thus providing
 both absolute accuracy and valid high-frequency measurements.
 It seems worthwhile to explore a similar approach for the vertical wind,
 to see if there is an advantage to a variable that is provided by an analogous
 complementary filter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the following refers to a variable GGVSPDB, a highest-resolution
 version of GGVSPD.
 GGVSPDB was used in this evaluation to ensure that the reduced resolution
 in GGVSPD did not influence the variance spectra, but GGVSPD is the usual
 variable used in wind calculation.
 It has sufficient resolution for that purpose, and there appears to be
 no advantage to using the higher-resolution variable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In standard processing, two vertical-wind variables are produced from the
 radome-based system, WI and WIC.
 These are called, respectively, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Wind Vector, Vertical Gust Component
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GPS-Corrected Wind Vector, Vertical Gust Component
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They are calculated by adding the relative wind measured by the radome
 system to the vertical motion of the aircraft, either VSPD (WI) or GGVSPD
 (WIC).
 The former is directly from the Honeywell IRU; the latter is produced by
 the GPS receiver and may benefit from OmniSTAR accuracy (flagged by GGQUAL
 equal to 5).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The names are not really appropriate and should be changed, but they appear
 in many past datasets.
 Neither is the gust component; both are the full vertical wind including
 relative wind and aircraft motion.
 Also, WIC is not GPS-corrected, it is completely based on the GPS and does
 not use the IRU at all except for the attitude angles need to determine
 the relative wind (the same for both).
 These calculations employ the nimbus function

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the Honeywell IRU provides a measurement of vertical acceleration.
 In a special calculation, this was integrated to get velocity and the result
 compared to VSPD.
 The results of the integration and the variance spectrum of that result
 were quite similar to VSPD, provided that a feedback loop was used to avoid
 exponentially growing errors from positive feedback, so there is no advantage
 to using that integrated acceleration in place of VSPD.
 (It was hoped that some of the filtering imposed on VSPD could be avoided.)

For evaluation of these measurements of aircraft velocity, it is useful
 to compare the variance spectra among them and to evaluate the contribution
 made to the vertical wind.
 For this purpose, one flight from DEEPWAVE, RF16 (4 July 2014) was used
 because it provided a good example of relatively intense and prolonged
 vertical motion, with the core 6 h period of the flight from 6:30:00 --
 12:30:00 having a standard deviation in vertical wind of 1.0
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

m/s.
 Much of the variation in vertical wind was from waves, so the field was
 not fully developed turbulence, but the signals to be resolved had enough
 intensity that noise floors on the measurements were not a problem.

 shows variance spectra calculated for the entire 6-h period, for a number
 of measurements entering the vertical-wind calculations.
 The thick blue trace shows the spectrum for the standard vertical wind
 measurement WIC, which has a pronounced broad peak near 10 km wavelength,
 a relatively small inertial subrange extending only to about 2 km, and
 (after smoothing in 50 logarithmic intervals across the range of the plot)
 uncertainty estimates that range from about 5% at the lowest frequencies
 to <1% at the highest frequencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two measures of vertical aircraft motion, GGVSPD (from the GPS receiver)
 and VSPD (from the inertial reference unit), have important differences
 in their properties.
 At high frequency, VSPD (orange line) decreases rapidly with increasing
 frequency, so it makes negligible contribution to the vertical wind (WI)
 at frequencies above 1 Hz.
 In contrast, GGVSPD (red line) does not show a similar steep drop in variance
 until after about 2 Hz, and it continues to make an important contribution
 to WIC over the frequency range from about 0.3 to 3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz.
 The absence of spectral variance above about 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz in VSPD appears to be the result of internal filtering of this signal
 in the inertial unit, and indeed some limited information on the properties
 of the signals does indicate filtering at about this frequency.
 Because the aircraft motion clearly has components in this frequency range
 (based on the feel of the ride in turbulence), it appears that WI should
 not be used for frequencies above about 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inertial-system variable VSPD is also subject to pressure damping, and
 this may account for the difference between GGVSPD and VSPD at long wavelength.
 The aircraft normally flies with reference to the pressure altitude, so
 in a region of varying altitude at a given pressure there are fluctuations
 in the aircraft geometric altitude (red line) not reflected in the pressure
 altitude (orange line).
 Both contribute in ways that result in essentially the same spectral variance
 for frequencies below 0.3 Hz, as shown by the near coincidence of the blue
 and cyan lines, so the difference is not significant.
 Here also, though, the red line representing the GPS measurement is a better
 measure of how the vertical wind should be affected, because the pressure-dampe
d orange line will not show real vertical motion of the aircraft as it remains
 on a pressure surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For these reasons, WIC is the preferable variable to use for vertical wind.
 This also answers the question posed earlier regarding the possibility
 of using a combination of measurements from inertial and GPS systems to
 obtain better frequency response.
 The IRU measurements turn out to have poorer frequency response and lead
 to apparent biases for frequencies around 1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz, so this is not a useful combination.
 Instead, it appears best to use the GPS-provided measurement of vertical
 aircraft speed directly without further modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is still some reason for concern about the spectral response of GGVSPD
 at frequencies around 0.5--1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz, because there is no evidence that the GPS is providing valid response
 at this high rate.
 The unit used provides measurements at 5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz and these measurements are interpolated and filtered to higher frequency,
 so the cut-off apparent in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Variance-spectra-VSPD"

\end_inset

 is a result of that sampling and may remove a real signal at higher frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The black trace (labeled GUSTW) is the vertical component of the relative
 wind.
 The sum of GUSTW and GGVSPD determines WIC, and the alternate measure of
 vertical wind WI is the sum of GUSTW and VSPD from the inertial reference
 unit.
 GUSTW has higher spectral variance than WIC for frequencies below 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz, so at these frequencies the aircraft motion tends to counter the relative
 wind and reduced the measured variance.
 This would be the case, for example, if there were negligible vertical
 wind and the relative wind arose entirely from the vertical motion of the
 aircraft.
 On the other hand, for frequencies around about 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz the spectral variance in the vertical wind exceeds that in the relative
 wind so the aircraft responds approximately in phase with the vertical
 gusts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The high-frequency variance spectrum has a slope differing a small amount
 from the expected -5/3 spectrum, and that is cause for some concern, but
 the turbulence in this region was not very well developed or consistent
 so this is probably not cause for alarm.
 Very good agreement with expectations has been seen in cases of boundary-layer
 measurements where well-developed turbulence at small scales is expected,
 but in those cases the intensity of turbulence at small scales was greater
 also.
 This is reason to continue to be suspicious of the response around 0.5--1

Consider eliminating the variable WI from the data archives.
 VSPD, on which WI is based, has problems at both high and low frequency.
 Providing this variable could lead to the mistaken expectation that this
 is the uncorrected version of WIC, while the two variables actually use
 different and independent measurements of the vertical motion of the aircraft.
 The argument for using a variable based on VSPD has been that this formerly
 represented the high-frequency contribution better than a GPS variable.
 That is not the case any longer, because GPS measurements have improved
 greatly and the presently available IRU-provided measurements are obviously
 filtered at high frequency.

VSPD does not have better frequency response than GGVSPDB at high frequency,
 as might be expected; the reverse is the case, possibly because of filters
 imposed on VSPD in the inertial unit itself.
 This argues for direct use of GGVSPDB in the vertical-wind calculation,
 at least when OmniSTAR corrections are available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The relative-wind variance spectrum shows higher variance than does that
 of the vertical wind, indicating that the contribution from aircraft motion
 counters the relative-wind contribution at all but the highest frequencies.
 The variable GGVSPDB is close to 180

) for frequencies smaller than 0.2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz.
 At low frequency, the motion of the aircraft probably produces more of
 the measured vertical component of the relative wind than does the real
 wind, while at intermediate frequency (near 0.1 Hz) the aircraft perhaps
 responds to the vertical wind so as to move out-of-phase with it, exaggerating
 the measured vertical component of the relative wind.
 There is a transition in phase from being above 180
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 to being below 180
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 as the frequency increases through 0.05
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

Hz, perhaps representing a transition from where the pilots or autopilot
 cause motions that produce the relative-wind vertical component to where
 the vertical wind causes the aircraft response.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
At high frequency (>0.3 Hz), the gust component dominates over the aircraft
 response, the coherence between them falls to values between 0.1--0.5, and
 the phase relationship becomes variable before settling near zero at 0.5
 Hz.

 The intensity of vertical-wind fluctuations was quite small for this flight
 segment, with a standard deviation in vertical wind of only about 0.2 m/s.
 Some features of this plot are explained below: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The measured vertical wind at high frequency (>1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz) is a white-noise spectrum with intensity that can be matched by generating
 a random-noise signal with peak amplitude of 0.15--0.2 m/s, which would lead
 to a random error of about (0.15--0.2)/
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{12}\simeq0.05$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s.
 The noise is dominated by the relative-wind contribution; there is essentially
 no contribution at these frequencies from the motion of the aircraft.
 The noise arises almost entirely from the angle-of-attack contribution
 to the relative wind, and specifically from the measurements 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ADIFR
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

QCR
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which exhibit noise spectra for frequencies above 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Hz.
 In ADIFR, the noise is at a level that would arise from a white-noise signal
 with peak amplitude of 0.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

hPa or a random error of about 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

hPa.
 Similar noise is present in both QCR and QCF, so it may be linked to the
 nature of the transducers used or to some effect originating in the pressure
 lines connecting the transducers to the ports.
 The specifications for the pressure transducer that measures ADIFR assert
 a standard uncertainty of about 0.03 hPa, and as sampled and digitized by
 the data system the resolution is about 0.002 hPa (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm70\,$
\end_inset

hPa for 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{16}$
\end_inset

 range digital encoding).
 Thus the white-noise spectrum indicates a random error about three times
 greater than expected from the transducer characteristics.
 This needs further investigation because it imposes an important limit
 on capability to measure low-intensity turbulence.

 if the amplitude of this contribution from the GPS measurements should
 be trusted at these frequencies.
 [XXX exploration of high-frequency GGVSPDB might be useful if such are
 available; they were not present in the 25-Hz file I used.] 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Timing of measurements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is necessary that the different measurements entering the calculation
 of vertical wind be sampled at the same time.
 That is particularly difficult in the case of samples from the inertial
 reference system and GPS because they produce sample streams according
 to their own timing and not in response to requests from the aircraft data
 system.
 The variables involved in calculating the vertical wind are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Angle of attack, from transducers attached to radome ports via lines that
 can introduce small lags.
 No lag is currently used in processing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pitch, from the IRU, transferred to the aircraft data system after some
 delay that must be removed in processing.
 The standard processing has a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

delay
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of -80
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

ms; i.e., the measurement is advanced in time by 80 ms so as to apply to a
 time later than when it is received.
 It is hard to understand how this is justified.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Other attitude angles (heading and roll), which enter in minor ways if the
 aircraft is not flying a straight-and-level course.
 The timing of these can probably be neglected for calculations of vertical
 wind, but the standard variables are also given a time lag of -80 ms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
True airspeed, measured using the pitot-tube measurement of dynamic pressure,
 used also with a measurement of temperature.
 While no lag is assumed for dynamic pressure, the reference total temperature
 for DEEPWAVE is RTHR1 (tentatively), and a time lag of -1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s is used for this measurement.
 (No lag is assumed for RTRL, another candidate for the reference temperature.)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The vertical speed of the aircraft, taken for the preferred vertical wind
 variable from GGVSPDB, the variable produced by the Novatel GPS receiver
 employing OmniSTAR corrections when possible.
 This variable is only sampled at a rate of 5 Hz, and no time lag is used
 in processing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to try to determine appropriate lags from the data and from
 appropriate maneuvers.
 For example, in pitch maneuvers (in which the pitch is alternately increased
 and decreased with typically a 10-s period) if the timing of measurements
 of pitch and angle-of-attack are not matched or if the measurement of vertical
 speed of the aircraft is not timed correctly there will be a residual measured
 vertical wind, so these maneuvers are particularly stringent tests of relative
 timing of the signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An approximate formula for the vertical wind 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
w=V\sin(\alpha-\theta)+w_{p}\label{eq:Weq}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is angle-of-attack, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is pitch and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the vertical velocity of the aircraft.
 This equation can be used to adjust relative timing among the signals to
 minimize the variance in vertical wind during the pitch maneuvers.
 A good example is that from DEEPWAVE flight 15, 3:15--3:18 UTC.
 As initially processed using standard processing at the time of DEEPWAVE,
 the standard deviation in vertical wind through the pitch maneuvers was
 0.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s while the variance in vertical motion of the aircraft was 5.6
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s.
 A long-standing criterion for acceptable pitch maneuvers is for less than
 10% of the imposed velocity to enter the vertical wind, so by this criterion
 the test was successful.
 However, a plot of the vertical wind shows a clear match to the imposed
 velocity, so it is worthwhile to see if better results are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speed runs have been used to determine the sensitivity coefficients for
 determining 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 from the measured pressure differences on the radome, so the sensitivity
 coefficients should not be adjusted on the basis of the pitch maneuvers.
 The relative timing of the measurements entering Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Weq"

\end_inset

, however, can be adjusted to determine if the residual vertical wind can
 be reduced.
 The sensors producing 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 are located close together and are processed in the standard manner by
 the data acquisition system, so these can be assumed to determine the reference
 time.
 However, the other variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 are determined by independent systems and may have timing offsets from
 the standard measurements, so these are the variables whose lags are explored
 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach was to shift the measurements forward or backward in time and,
 using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Weq"

\end_inset

, recalculate the vertical wind.
 The best result obtained in this way was to shift PITCH forward 0.04
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s and shift GGVSPDB backward 0.04
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s.
 Almost as good was to shift PITCH forward 0.08
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s and shift GGVSPDB backward 0.04
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s.
 This reset the assumed lag in PITCH to zero while imposing a small lag
 of -0.04
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s in GGVSPDB.
 For the purpose of this study, to avoid the phase lag produced by filters
 at the high-frequency limit, Savitzky-Golay filtering was used for GGVSPDB
 with 4th-order polynomials applied over 25-measurement intervals to smooth
 the original measurements.
 The resulting standard deviation in WIX was 0.22
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s, vs 0.23 with no shift in GGVSPDB, so it may be preferable to leave the
 assumed lag for GGVSPDB at zero to avoid the awkwardness of advancing the
 measurement in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the assumed time lag in PITCH removed, the resulting measurement of
 vertical wind during the pitch maneuver is shown in Fig.

There is little signal corresponding to the imposed vertical motion or variation

 It thus appears that the measuring system is able to remove the effects
 of the pitch maneuvers with essentially undetectable residual.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Constraints arising from the assumption that the wind is steady
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The circle maneuver is a stringent test of the wind measurements because,
 in steady conditions, the measured wind should remain constant around the
 circles.
 From the patterns of deviations with orientation in the turn, it is possible
 to detect an error in true airspeed or an offset in heading or sideslip.
 A time offset in mneasured ground speed from the GPS relative to the IRU
 can be detected from an apparent change in required heading offset that
 changes sign with the direction of the turn.
 In addition, for circles flown with steady bank angle, the drift of the
 ground track as detected by GPS measures the wind without any reference
 to the measuring system on the aircraft, so this provides a standard against
 which the wind measurements can be checked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these will be explored in this section.
 To get accurate circle patterns, it is important that the wind be relatively
 steady and non-turbulent and that the roll angle be maintained constant.
 For this flight segment, the left-turn circles had a roll angle of 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

0.12, while the mean true airspeed for these circles was 153.5
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

 Most of the standard deviation in true airspeed arose from the normal fluctuati

 The steadiness of these measurements indicates that this maneuver was flown

The quantity used in all these tests is the relative wind in Earth-based
 coordinates, with east and north components given approximately by {
\begin_inset Formula $V\sin\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $V\cos\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

} where 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{\prime}=\psi+\beta\cos\phi-\alpha\sin\phi$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 the heading, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 the sideslip angle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 the roll angle, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 the angle of attack.
 In the circle maneuver, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\approx27^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 so the last two terms in the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 do not simplify with the small-angle approximation.
 If the corresponding components of the horizontal wind are 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{y}$
\end_inset

If error terms for true airspeed (

\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{\prime}=\psi_{m}^{\prime}+\delta\psi^{\prime}$

 where subscript

 refers to the measured quantity, and if it is assumed that the wind components
 {
\begin_inset Formula $v_{x}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{y}$
\end_inset

Once the average wind direction (

\begin_layout Plain Layout
With equal weighting for measurements with all orientations relative to
 the wind, averaging measurements should give correct values even if there
 are errors in the individual terms
\end_layout

\end_inset

 the error 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta v_{m}$
\end_inset

 in the measurement of wind speed (
\begin_inset Formula $v_{m}$
\end_inset

) can be expressed as
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta v_{m}=v_{m}-v=-\delta V\cos\xi-V\delta\xi\sin\xi\label{eq:delta-v-m}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi=\psi^{\prime}-\lambda$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the relative wind and the direction (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

) of the wind relative to the Earth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation is justified as follows.
 Because the relative wind transformed to an Earth reference frame is added
 to the ground-speed vector to find the wind, an error 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta V$
\end_inset

 in true airspeed leads to an error of the same magnitude in the component
 of measured wind along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
 The measured wind therefore changes by 
\begin_inset Formula $-2\delta V$
\end_inset

 when the aircraft changes from an upwind to a downwind flight direction,
 with the negative sign arising from the convention that wind direction
 is specified as the direction from which the wind blows.
 The error in true airspeed thus can be determined from the difference between
 wind measured while flying upwind and that measured while flying downwind.
 For other flight directions, this error projects to the wind direction
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\delta V\cos(\psi^{\prime})$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, when flying crosswind the wind measurement is determined by
 the sum of the ground-speed component along the wind direction and the
 component of the relative wind lateral to the aircraft.
 If the wind is from the port side of the aircraft (e.g., for an east flight
 direction with wind from the north), a positive heading error leads to
 a relative wind component opposing the wind and so to a measurement error
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $-V\delta\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 For wind from the starboard side of the aircraft, the sign reverses, and
 for other angles the error contribution is 
\begin_inset Formula $-V\delta\psi^{\prime}\sin(\psi^{\prime})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fitting to minimize the deviations expressed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:delta-v-m"

\end_inset

 can then give estimates of the three fit parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta V$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, or a fixed value can be used for 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 as given by the mean of measurements or by a previous fit to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:v-errors"

\end_inset

.
 These fits should give consistent results, but a fit to 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:delta-v-m"

\end_inset

 is particularly illustrative because plots of the error as a function of
 flight direction relative to the wind clearly reveal the magnitude and
 source of the deviations.

There is an apparently significant difference of about 1

m/s in mean wind speed, both measured and resulting from the fits, between
 the right-turn circles and the left-turn circles.
 This is apparently a real difference between wind conditions in the regions
 where the circles were flown and is supported by the difference between
 maximum and minimum ground speed for the two sets of circles.
 Conditions are more uniform for the right-turn circles, as reflected in
 the lower residual error for those circles, so more weight will be given
 here to the results from the right-turn circles.
 Both indicate a small heading error, but that was obtained by imposing
 a shift forward for the ground-speed measurements GGVEW and GGVNS of 840

Except as it applies to this study, this shift normally has little effect

Some of the fits, notably the left-turn circles from the third maneuver,
 don't conform very well to the expected sinusoidal error pattern.
 The residual error about the fit was the largest of the circles, with the
 right-turn circles having almost as large a residual error, which may indicate
 that conditions were not sufficiently uniform to use these maneuvers.
 The average indicated error in airspeed from all six circle maneuvers was
 0.2
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$

0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, and the indicated error in adjusted heading 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 was 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.02\pm0.09^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 These are useful constraints on the uncertainty associated with these key
 contributors to uncertainty in measured wind.

 Because the wind is more nearly uniform and the pattern of measurements

 because Fig.

 vs the left-turn circles, here the right-turn circles will be emphasized.
 They indicate that the wind measurements (with time-shifting as discussed
 above) are quite good, with indicated errors of only 0.2

 For the right-turn circles, the significant departures are for parts of
 the circles nearly into the wind direction, where the circles start and
 end, so it may be that those small deviations arise from imperfect flight
 patterns for those times.

\begin_layout Standard
In the preceding, the error 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\psi$
\end_inset

 was discussed as an error in heading, but the error could also be one in
 sideslip.
 These errors are difficult to separate and normal reverse-heading maneuvers
 do not provide a separation.
 Furthermore, heading errors may change during a flight because error terms
 undergo a Schuler oscillation and are also affected by horizontal accelerations
 such as occur persistently in turns like those in the circle maneuver.
 The error term determined as in the above tables should be represented
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

from yaw maneuvers, but those maneuvers also cannot separate an offset in
 heading from an offset in sideslip so the first coefficient in the calibration,
 representing the zero offset, is not constrained well by these maneuvers.
 Because the dependence in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:dpsiprime"

\end_inset

) is on the cosine of the roll which is an even function, left and right
 turns are affected in the same way and also cannot distinguish the two
 terms in the equation.
 Although three different altitudes were used for these circle maneuvers,
 the GV flight management system maintains nearly the same roll angle for
 all three maneuvers, so changes in roll also cannot be used to distinguish
 the contributions from heading offset and sideslip offset.

 In the turns, some sideslip is introduced as the aircraft configuration
 remains slightly nose-up during the turn, and that sideslip should reverse
 sign by symmetry when the flight pattern changes from left-turn to right-turn
 circles.
 The lift required to maintain altitude would be the same if the roll angles
 were opposite, as they nearly are for these maneuvers (0.45
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 larger for right turns), and the angle of attack is also close to the same,
 so the expected sign reversal in sideslip can be used to estimate the offset
 in sideslip.

The mean value for the full maneuver, and the average of the right-turn
 and left-turn circles, both indicate that there is no offset in the sideslip.
 This is a forced result, though, because the sensitivity coefficients for
 sideslip have been adjusted from a preliminary version of this plot to
 give symmetry, and an adjustment of 0.07
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 was required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When this approach was applied to the C-130, it was found that for that
 aircraft the pitch could differ significantly for right vs.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

left turns, so a different approach taking into account the influence of
 all angles on vertical wind was also used.
 The transformation equations from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 (see also 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "NCAR_OpenSky_TECH-NOTE-000-000-000-064"

\end_inset

), with some small-angle simplifications, lead to this equation for the
 vertical wind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u_{z}=w_{p}+V(\sin\phi\tan\beta+\cos\phi\tan\alpha-\sin\theta\label{eq:vwind-eq-for-SS}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the vertical motion of the aircraft, 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 its true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 the roll angle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 the sideslip angle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 the angle of attack, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 the pitch angle.
 If it is assumed that the vertical wind is zero, in the circle maneuver
 this equation predicts that the sideslip angle will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$
\end_inset

 given by
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta^{*}\approx\frac{\theta-\alpha\cos\phi-(w_{p}/V)}{\sin\phi}\,\,\,.\label{eq:beta-from-other-measurements}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is not useful in straight flight where the roll is near zero, but it
 provides a valid equation for sideslip in the case of steady turns.
 The key assumption is that the vertical wind is zero; a vertical wind of
 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s will typically increase the deduced sideslip from this equation by about
 0.06
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so it is important that the circle maneuver be flown where there is no
 mean updraft.

 The uncertainty in the mean of this result is very low, and this result

The complementary filter
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wind measurements combine a measurement of relative wind with a measurement
 of aircraft motion to determine the air motion relative to the ground.
 The aircraft motion has long been measured by an IRS, and recently also
 by a GPS.
 These have complementary strengths: The IRS provides very good information
 on short-term motion but drifts with a characteristic period of more than
 an hour, while the GPS provides good absolute accuracy but sometimes is
 unable to receive the GPS signals and (except in differential-GPS mode)
 can have short-term errors that make short segments of the track look jagged.
 To take advantage of the strengths of each, a complementary-filter calculation
 was developed and implemented in the 1980s, but it was never documented
 publicly.
 This section is partly an attempt to remedy that and partly a suggestion
 to make some minor changes to how it is implemented.
 This discussion is complementary to the information in ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf,
 section 3.4, and contains additional detail as well as notes regarding implement
ation of changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To accomplish this combining of measurements, a low-pass filter, 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{L}(\{\mathrm{GVNS,GVEW\}})$
\end_inset

, is applied to the GPS measurements of ground speed, {GVNS,GVEW}, which
 are assumed to be valid for frequencies at or lower than the cutoff frequency
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

 of the filter.
 Then the complementary high-pass filter, denoted (
\begin_inset Formula $1-F_{L}$
\end_inset

)(
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathrm{VNS,VEW\}}$
\end_inset

), is applied to the IRS measurements of ground speed, {VNS,VEW}, which
 are assumed valid for frequencies at or higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Ideally, the transition frequency would be selected where the GPS errors
 (increasing with frequency) are equal to the IRS errors (decreasing with
 frequency).
 The filter used is a three-pole Butterworth low-pass filter, coded following
 the algorithm described in Bosic, S.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

M., 1980: 
\emph on
Digital and Kalman filtering : An Introduction to Discrete-Time Filtering
 and Optimum Linear Estimation, 
\emph default
p.
 49.
 The digital filter used is recursive, not centered, to permit calculation
 during a single pass through the data.
 If the cutoff frequency lies where both the GPS and INS measurements are
 valid and are almost the same, then the detailed characteristics of the
 filter in the transition region (e.g., phase shift) do not matter because
 the complementary filters have cancelling effects when applied to the same
 signal.
 The transition frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

 was chosen to be (1/600) Hz (but this value can be overridden via the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defaults
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file).
 The Butterworth filter was chosen because it provides flat response away
 from the transition.
 The resulting variables for aircraft motion, {VNSC,VEWC}, are then each
 the sum of two filtered signals, calculated as described in the following

This is straightforward and effective when both sets of measurements (IRS
 and GPS) are available.
 The approach in use becomes more complicated when the GPS signals are lost,
 as sometimes happens in sharp turns.
 Then some means is needed to avoid sudden discontinuities in velocity (and
 hence wind speed), which would introduce spurious effects into variance
 spectra and other properties dependent on a continuously valid measurement
 of wind.
 To extrapolate measurements through periods when the GPS measurements are
 not available, a fit is determined to the difference between the best-estimate
 variables {VNSC, VEWC} and the IRS variables {VNS,VEW} for the period before
 GPS reception was lost, and that fit is used to extrapolate through periods
 when GPS reception is not available.
 The procedure is described in section 3.4 of ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf.

The following provides more documentation of the fit procedure used to determine
 the Schuler oscillation.
 The errors are assumed to result primarily from this oscillation, so the
 three-term fit is of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta=c_{1}+c_{2}\sin(\Omega_{Sch}t)+c_{3}\cos(\Omega_{Sch}t)$
\end_inset

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{Sch}$
\end_inset

 is the angular frequency of the Schuler oscillation (taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi/(5067\,s))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 is the time since the start of the flight.
 A separate fit is used for each component of the velocity and each component
 of the position (discussed below under LATC and LONC).
 The fit matrix used to determine these coefficients is updated each time
 step but the accumulated fit factors decay exponentially with about 30-min
 decay constant, so the terms used to determine the fit are exponentially
 weighted over the period of valid data with a time constant that decays
 exponentially into the past with a characteristic time of 30 min.
 This is long enough to determine a significant portion of the Schuler oscillati
on but short enough to emphasize recent measurements of the correction.
 The procedures for accumulating the matrices for the fit are as follows:

 of each component contributing to the measurement of wind, and it discusses
 what is known about specifications for uncertainty associated with those
 components.
 It also includes description of the algorithm leading to components of
 the measured wind, and it discusses the three independent systems available
 for measuring wind on the GV.

 Section 4 provides key information on how calibration maneuvers are used
 to determine the sensitivity of some of the measurements to components
 of the wind.
 This section on calibration is key to the uncertainty analysis because
 to a large extent many of the potential errors from sensors are removed
 by this calibration, and the calibration becomes the central factor affecting
 the final uncertainty.
 Other intermediate sections discuss some specific tests applied to the
 measurements in order to check or reduce the uncertainty limits associated
 with these measurements.
 These sections (3, 5, and 6) go somewhat beyond a conventional analysis
 of uncertainty in that there are some new developments discussed there
 and some unconventional ways of checking the measurements.

\begin_layout Standard
Because three wind-measuring systems are characterized in this report, they
 will be discussed separately.
 However, the standard system is the radome-based system, so that will be
 treated in the most depth.
 The other two systems, the under-wing gust pod and the LAMS, are new systems
 and their characteristics are still being developed and explored, so their
 discussion necessarily will be incomplete until additional flight data
 are collected.

Vertical wind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the calculation of wind from the contributing measurements involves
 coordinate transformations, evaluation of the uncertainty in wind components
 involves difficult error propagation through the transformation matrices
 and other equations of Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 For application to straight-and-level flight (or flight where the intent
 is to remain level), simplified equations suffice for evaluation of the
 error terms, but it will also be useful to employ Monte-Carlo simulations
 to be sure that error contributions are propagated correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the vertical wind, Eq.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

if it is assumed that the angle of attack 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula

and errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta w$
\end_inset

) can be related to the errors in the basic measurements (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta V$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\delta\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula $\delta\theta$

\begin_inset Formula $\delta w_{p}$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta w=(\alpha-\theta)\delta V+V(\delta\alpha-\delta\theta)+\delta w_{p}\,\,\,.\label{eq:delta-w}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Correlations among these error terms are possible, so a full evaluation
 that does not assume independence among the errors leads to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\left\langle (\delta w)^{2}\right\rangle  & = & (\alpha-\theta)^{2}\left\langle (\delta V)^{2}\right\rangle +V^{2}\left(\left\langle (\delta\alpha)^{2}\right\rangle +\left\langle (\delta\theta)^{2}\right\rangle \right)+\left\langle (\delta w_{p})^{2}\right\rangle \nonumber \\
 &  & +2\left((\alpha-\theta)\left(V(\left\langle \delta V\delta\alpha\right\rangle -\left\langle \delta V\delta\theta\right\rangle )+\left\langle \delta V\delta w_{p}\right\rangle \right)\right)\nonumber \\
 &  & +2V\left(\left\langle \delta\alpha\delta w_{p}\right\rangle +\left\langle \delta\theta\delta w_{p}\right\rangle \right)-2V^{2}\left\langle \delta\alpha\delta\theta\right\rangle \label{eq:delta-w-sq}

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The error in pitch arises from measurements from the IRU and is affected
 mostly by an initial offset during alignment and then further changes in
 this error arising from the Schuler oscillation and from accelerations
 that affect this error.
 The error in angle-of-attack, on the other hand, arises from a combination
 of measurement error from the pressure transducers and error in the formula
 used to deduce angle-of-attack from the pressure measurements.
 This error is not independent of the error in pitch, however, because the
 calibration as presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Calibration-AOA"

\end_inset

 relies on the measured difference between pitch and angle of attack being
 zero when the vertical wind and vertical aircraft motion are zero.
 Thus any bias in pitch is transferred to a bias in angle of attack, so
 this component of the error in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:delta-w-sq-simplified"

\end_inset

 should cancel.
 The remaining errors arise from sources that are independent and likely
 uncorrelated, so the middle term on the right side of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:delta-w-sq-simplified"

\end_inset

 will be neglected in this preliminary analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to estimate the magnitudes of these errors from measurements.
 Because the GV instrumentation includes two identical inertial systems,
 the difference in measurements of pitch from those two systems provides
 one lower-bound estimate of the uncertainty in pitch.
 Measurements discussed in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 suggest that, for periods when the roll of the aircraft was within 5

 of zero, the difference between these redundant measurements was about
 0.3
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Schuler"

\end_inset

 presents additional evidence from evaluation of the Schuler coupling between
 pitch or roll errors and ground-speed errors, also indicating that typical
 pitch errors are of about this magnitude.
 This is significantly smaller than the manufacturer's specified uncertainty
 for this instrument, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.05^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This uncertainty in pitch is comparable to the estimated random uncertainty
 in angle-of-attack, for which the variance spectra discussed in Sect.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The estimated uncertainties in angle-of-attack and pitch are thus comparable,
 and both influence the uncertainty in vertical wind.

 Other factors, esp.

\end_inset

the radome calibration, need to be considered for a refined estimate, as
 presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Horizontal wind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Errors in measurements affect the longitudinal and lateral components of
 the horizontal wind in different ways.
 For the longitudinal component (along the aircraft longitudinal axis),
 the relative-wind measurement (essentially the true airspeed) has been
 calibrated by comparison to measurements of the single-beam LAMS, leading
 to an estimated standard uncertainty of about 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s (Cooper et al., 2014).
 The LAMS measurement is based on measurement of the Doppler shift and thus
 has low limits for bias and precision, dependent primarily on the uncertainty
 associated with determining the peak in the returned Doppler spectrum in
 the presence of turbulence.
 The lateral component is measured using the sideslip angle, which is determined
 in a manner similar to that used to calibrate the measurement of angle-of-attac
k.
 However, the zero reference angle for attack is determined well by assuming
 that, on average in quiescent air, the vertical wind should be zero.
 No similar reference angle exists for sideslip, and trim adjustments to
 the aircraft can change the mean sideslip angle, so a different procedure
 with additional sources of uncertainty must be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two maneuvers are particularly effective for determining the zero reference
 for sideslip (at which angle the lateral horizontal component of the relative
 wind would be zero): (i) Reverse-heading maneuvers, where a straight leg
 is flown for a short time (typically 2 min), then the aircraft reverses
 heading and flies back along the reverse heading, with the result that
 the wind component perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the aircraft
 should reverse sign; or (ii) constant-bank circles flown drifting with
 the wind, for which the lateral component of the wind should exhibit a
 sinusoidal variation around the circle reflecting a possible heading and/or
 sideslip error.
 Both maneuvers can provide a reference for correcting a combination of
 heading and sideslip errors, and the circle maneuver provides a mechanism
 for determining the sideslip error alone, as discussed in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Analysis-of-circle"

\end_inset

.
 There the uncertainty associated with the bias in sideslip was indicated
 to be about 0.06
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and the random uncertainty in heading was estimated to be less than 0.09
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, with a bias limit comparable to that in sideslip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for vertical wind, the GPS-measured components of aircraft motion relative
 to the Earth have uncertainty significantly less than that of the relative
 wind, so errors are dominated by those arising from the relative-wind component
s and from the transformation to Earth coordinates.
 The first-order equation for the lateral component of the relative wind
 (
\begin_inset Formula $v_{y}$
\end_inset

), analogous to Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Weq-1"

\end_inset

, is 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{y}=V\beta$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is the sideslip angle.
 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is known to typically 0.05% so the error is dominated by that in sideslip
 and in heading.
 For the random error, one limit is obtained as for angle-of-attack by examining
 the variance spectrum in calm conditions.
 However, BDIFR and SSLIP do not exhibit such pure noise spectra at high
 frequency as did ADIFR and AKRD.
 The QCF variance spectrum has characteristics of noise for amplitudes of
 random errors of about 0.15
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

hPa, slightly higher than estimated for ADIFR.
 For BDIFR, an example is shown in Fig.

Variance spectrum for BDIFR for DEEPWAVE flight 15, 3:40--3:55 UTC.

The slope in the high-frequency region does not match that expected for
 a white-noise signal, for which the variance would be constant and in these
 plots, where the spectral density is multiplied by the frequency, the plotted
 line should increase linearly with frequency parallel to the orange dashed
 lines.
 Instead, the spectrum for BDIFR has smaller slope than this, looking perhaps
 as if the spectrum starts out at a point where a white-noise spectrum with
 standard deviation 0.1

 so that at the high-frequency limit the equivalent white-noise standard
 deviation would be 0.05

hPa.
 The spectrum for SSLIP looks similarly filtered, with an equivalent white-noise
 spectrum somewhere in the range of 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, similar to that characterizing AKRD.
 However, the estimated uncertainty in the bias for the combined effects
 of sideslip and heading was, from the circle analysis, 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.09^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and these lead to contributions to the uncertainty in bias of the lateral
 wind of about 0.3
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s.
 The horizontal wind thus has an asymmetrical estimated uncertainty, about
 three times as large for the lateral component as for the longitudinal
 component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like vertical wind, this uncertainty estimate for the horizontal wind needs
 to be refined for application to the Earth-relative wind by consideration
 of the uncertainty in the determination of sensitivity coefficients for
 sideslip and other contributions to the net uncertainty in wind.

 The uncertainty is assigned to bias because it is likely a calibration
 uncertainty and the resolution and stability are much smaller than this
 bias.
 However, a calibration bias in this measurement does not affect the final
 wind measurement because the procedure in Sect.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 determines the angle of attack from flight data in a way that can be considered
 a calibration of the measurement of angle of attack, and a bias in ADIFR
 would be reflected in a change in sensitivity coefficients determined in
 that section that would compensate for that bias.
 Only random errors in ADIFR would propagate to the final measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, and such errors are thought to be negligible, so the propagated error
 for ADIFR is listed as negligible.

 It is important, though, that the calibration is dependent on the assumption
 that the mean vertical wind where the calibration data were collected be
 zero.
 This is discussed in Sect.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 There is no independent way to check this except by comparing results from
 different regions as done in this report.
 That remains a major weakness in calibration and is the major contributor
 to uncertainty in angle of attack, but it introduces a bias arising from
 a possible calibration error.
 Fluctuations from the mean value are measured with uncertainty a factor
 of ten smaller than this bias.
 The assumed mean value of the vertical wind leading to this bias was 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 In that section, it was estimated that the standard error in pitch is 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and that this is primarily in the form of a slowly varying error that,
 over measurement periods short compared to the Schuler oscillation period
 of 84.4

min, will appear as a bias.
 The correction procedure represented by Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 corrects for this error well enough to leave the residual bias negligible,
 so the bias entry in Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Elemental-w"

\end_inset

 can be eliminated by application of that algorithm.
 The partitioning between bias and random uncertainty depends on the interval
 considered, because Schuler precession will cause variation in this error
 with the Schuler-oscillation period of about 84 min.
 For periods long compared to this the error will have the character of
 a random-error component, so using 0.08
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s would be appropriate for random uncertainty of such long-term measurements
 while the bias should be reduced substantially, perhaps to 0.02
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

m/s.
 For periods small compared to the Schuler period, the pitch error appears
 as a bias and there is a much smaller random error, evaluated in Sect.

 This is the usual case for measurements of interest, so the bias and random
 errors are partitioned as appropriate for this case in the table.
 The uncertainty in pitch is the leading contributor to the standard uncertainty

 and so will make a contributor to uncertainty in vertical wind that is
 comparable to the contributions from pitch and angle of attack.
 The error in aircraft vertical speed is likely a mixture of bias and random
 error, because the primary source is uncertainty in ionospheric corrections
 which will be persistent for important parts of flights but likely to change
 at least from flight to flight.
 Because of the likely persistence of the error, it is assigned here primarily
 to bias.

PSF:

 The measured ambient pressure affects vertical wind only through the dependence
 of true airspeed TASX on PSF, as described in the document on

, Section 4.7.1.
 Evaluation at typical values shows that the dependence of measured vertical
 wind on uncertainty in this variable is negligible.
 For example, TASX for PSF=300
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa, QCF=80
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa, and ATX=

m

 or about 0.01%, so this would also be the percentage change in vertical
 wind.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

ATX:
\series default
 Temperature is needed to calculate TASX, but as for PSF the effect is negligibl
e.
 This was tested as for PSF by evaluating at representative points.
 A representative result was that the listed bias in temperature would lead
 to a bias in TASX of about 0.05%, leading to a similar percentage change
 in the value of the vertical wind.
 This is negligible in comparison to other sources of uncertainty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of adding the elemental sources of uncertainty in quadrature
 is a bias estimate of 0.10

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

s

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

 Without the correction, the bias estimate increases to 0.35
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

, so the pitch correction results in significant reduction in uncertainty
 and without that correction the uncertainty is dominated by the bias introduced
 by the measurement of pitch.
 In the corrected case, the dominant contributions are those from pitch
 and angle of attack, as was argued in the preliminary discussion in Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The bias and random errors from pitch and from angle of attack, as listed
 here, arise from different sources so it is reasonable to combine them
 in quadrature to obtain composite estimates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The APPLANIX IRU should provide another route to improvement in the measurement
 of pitch, because it offers significantly lower specified uncertainty.
 It achieves this through use of a full Kalman-filter correction to the
 measurements, which would remove the need for the pitch correction proposed
 in this document.

} in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 It was necessary to use additional terms to obtain a good fit in this case,
 but the final result provided a very good representation of the data, as
 good as in the radome case.
 We have therefore used the same uncertainty estimate as for the radome,
 although with less justification and study.
 As for the radome, the dominant source of bias is again the uncertainty
 in vertical wind in the calibration region, which is the same for this
 data set as for that used to determine the radome sensitivity coefficients,
 so this estimate remains the same as for the radome.
 The uncertainties also propagate to the vertical wind in the same way.
 However, the restriction to low roll angle (less than 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 from vertical) is still more important in the case of the gust pod because
 the CMIGITS IRU used with the gust pod is not aligned with the aircraft
 longitudinal axis but rather is mounted in an under-wing pod that was designed
 to point into the airflow and therefore slightly inward relative to the
 longitudinal axis.
 That causes significant problems in turns because the IRU rotates in ways
 that mix the attitude angles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
BDIF_GP:
\series default
 The sideslip angle has negligible effect on the vertical wind as long as
 the roll angle is small, so for measurements made during straight-and-level
 flight this contribution to uncertainty in vertical wind is negligible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
QCF and QC_GP:
\series default
 Two measurements are listed because both are used in the calculation of
 vertical wind.
 QC_GP is used with ADIF_GP to determine the angle of attack, and the calibratio
n described with item 2 effectively replaces uncertainty in this measurement
 with uncertainty in the sensitivity coefficients.
 However, true airspeed is determined using QCF because the conventional
 true airspeed is thought to be superior to the new value determined solely
 from the gust pod (Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:GP-TAS"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, the effect of uncertainty in QCF on vertical wind is the same
 as that for the radome because the same calculated true airspeed is used
 for both.

pitch (CPITCH_GP):
\series default
 As was the case for the cabin-mounted inertial systems, there were two
 nearly identical inertial systems used in the wing pods, one for the gust
 pod and the other for the LAMS, so it is again possible to compare the
 measurements and obtain estimates of the random errors in their measurements.
 For both units (LAMS and gust pod), the inertial systems use GPS measurements
 with a Kalman filter to apply corrections, but they align independently
 and so have different errors and Schuler oscillations.
 There were many flights in DEEPWAVE where one of these was not operational:
 1--4, 6--7, 15, 17, 19.
 For the other flights, the standard deviation in the difference in pitch
 between these two units was 0.06
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so this is a reasonable estimate of the random error that characterizes
 these measurements.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The standard deviation in the difference between two variables is actually
 
\begin_inset Formula $sqrt(2)\times\delta$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the standard deviation in each variable, so a better estimate is 0.04;
 this correction has not been made throughout this document.
\end_layout

\end_inset

As for the radome, a true bias in this measurement (e.g., from misalignment
 at installation) has been subsumed by the calibration of item 2 so does
 not enter in this item.
 However, the remaining error on most flights has a slowly varying component
 (consistent with the long time period of the Schuler oscillation) and so
 appears as a bias for any measurement made over a period short compared
 to the Schuler oscillation, so it appears appropriate to assign the observed
 standard deviation primarily to a bias because it will appear steady in
 normal applications that look at vertical wind over periods short compared
 to the Schuler oscillation.
 We have therefore partitioned the standard deviation into estimated components
 of 0.04
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 bias and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.02^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 random error.
 The uncertainty in pitch is the leading contributor to the standard uncertainty
 in vertical wind and is also the leading contributor to the overall estimate
 of bias.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Aircraft Vertical Velocity:
\series default
 For the gust pod, the measurement of vertical motion of the aircraft must
 be that from the IRU mounted in the under-wing pod because the wing can
 flex and vibrate and the aircraft can roll in ways that cause that vertical
 motion to differ from that sensed in the cabin.
 Again, comparing the two units mounted in side-by-side wing pods provides
 the best indication of the random component of uncertainty in this measurement,
 because both units experience almost identical vertical motion.
 These two units measure project-mean vertical aircraft motions that differ
 by 0.04
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, with standard deviation in that difference of 0.07
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 It seems reasonable then to estimate the random component of uncertainty
 as 0.07
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, but the bias is more uncertain.
 Good flights usually produced mean vertical aircraft motion from takeoff
 to landing of less than 0.005
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

 (which is updated for stability in the IRU using pressure altitude as a

BDIFR:

 The primary uncertainty in BDIFR is assigned to bias because it is likely
 a calibration uncertainty and the resolution and stability are much smaller
 than this bias.
 However, a calibration bias in this measurement does not affect the final
 wind measurement because the procedure in Sect.

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 determines the sideslip angle from flight data in a way that can be considered
 a calibration of the measurement of sideslip, and a bias in BDIFR would
 be reflected in a change in sensitivity coefficients determined in that
 section that would compensate for that bias.
 Only random errors in BDIFR propagate to the final measurement of horizontal
 wind, and the effect of the listed random error is typically less than
 0.0001 m/s in lateral wind, with even smaller contribution to the longitudinal
 wind.
 These contributions therefore are listed as negligible in the table.
 The next item considers the determination of sensitivity coefficient for
 sideslip and is the dominant contribution to uncertainty in horizontal
 wind arising from the measurement of sideslip.

 The angle of attack has negligible effect on the horizontal wind as long

QCF:

 The values listed are the characteristics of the transducer.
 Application of the calibration procedure based on comparison to the laser
 air motion sensor (

) led to an estimated standard uncertainty of 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s for steady flight conditions and 0.3
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s for fluctuating conditions, so this is used for the table entry pertaining
 to the wind component in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the
 aircraft.
 For the lateral component, QCF affects the calculated sideslip SSRD, but
 as in the case of AKRD the procedure to determine sensitivity coefficients
 removes any effect of bias in QCF by calibration in terms of the coefficients
 {
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0},\,c_{1}$
\end_inset

} so a potential bias in QCF does not enter the lateral component of the
 horizontal wind but instead is replaced by possible bias in those coefficients,
 as discussed for element 2.
 The effect of a random error in QCF of 0.01

 values of sideslip are smaller in magnitude than 1

 However, the standard deviation of the difference between the two measurements

PITCH:

 Evaluation at typical values shows that the dependence of the measured
 lateral component of the horizontal wind on uncertainty in this variable
 is negligible.
 For example, TASX for PSF=300

hPa, QCF=80
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

hPa, and ATX=

 or about 0.01%, so this would also be the percentage change in the lateral
 component of the relative wind.

 Typical values of Mach number for the DEEPWAVE project were 0.8, for which
 a temperature change of

 The temperature error is likely a bias, so this difference also should
 be treated as a bias.
 The result is that the longitudinal component of the horizontal wind has
 an elemental contribution from temperature of 0.16
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

m/s, while the lateral component (being small and having an error proportional
 to the error in TASX of about 0.16/240 or smaller than 0.1%) has negligible

 The uncertainty in the determination of the correction was estimated in

For the lateral component of the wind, adding the elemental contributions
 to uncertainty in quadrature leads to a net bias estimate of 0.4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s and a random uncertainty of 0.2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 The measurement of heading makes a dominating contribution to each.
 For the longitudinal component, the corresponding results are 0.3 and 0.2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 Here the dominant contribution arises from the corrections applied to dynamic
 pressure to address the measured static defect as determined from calibrations.
 Measurements of the longitudinal wind provided by the LAMS have uncertainty
 of only about 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, so when this instrument is available the uncertainty could be reduced;
 the tabulated uncertainty includes an estimate of how well the parameterized
 function used to correct pressure in the absence of LAMS actually represents
 those measurements adequately.
 Some of the uncertainty entering this assessment arises because the LAMS
 and the radome gust-sensing system measure at locations displaced from
 each other and so may encounter slightly different wind conditions.

 a calibration of the measurement of sideslip, and a bias in BDIF_GP would
 be reflected in a change in sensitivity coefficients determined in that

 Only random errors in BDIF_GP propagate to the final measurement of horizontal
 wind, and the effect of the listed random error is typically less than
 0.0001 m/s in lateral wind, with even smaller contribution to the longitudinal

 These contributions therefore are listed as negligible in the table.

 For sideslip, the fit procedure used values of heading and ground speed
 components determined from the gust-pod IRU, but wind components determined
 from the radome system.
 This allowed better determination of sensitivity coefficients than would
 have been possible from "bootstrapping" gust-pod measurements using repeated
 iterations, because the wind measurements from the radome system have lower
 uncertainty than those from the gust-pod system.
 However, this means for example that the offset in sideslip or heading
 will be dependent on the values from the radome system.

 Application of the calibration procedure based on comparison to the laser

) led to an estimated standard uncertainty of 0.1

\begin_inset space ~

m/s for fluctuating conditions, so this is used for the table entry pertaining
 to the wind component in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the
 aircraft.
 For the lateral component, QC_GP affects the calculated sideslip SS_GP,
 but the procedure to determine sensitivity coefficients removes any effect
 of bias in QC_GP by calibration in terms of the coefficients {
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0},\,c_{1}$
\end_inset

} so a potential bias in QC_GP does not enter the lateral component of the
 horizontal wind but instead is replaced by possible bias in those coefficients,
 as discussed for element 2.

HEADING (CTHDG_GP):
\series default
 The random error in heading can be evaluated by comparing the two duplicate
 IRUs for the gust pod and the LAMS, as was done for pitch.
 In DEEPWAVE, these two systems differed in mean heading by about 1.3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, evidently a result of being installed at different angles relative to
 the aircraft longitudinal axis.
 The standard deviation in the difference in heading measurements from the
 two systems, after excluding some additional flights (18, 22, 25) where
 there appeared to be problems with the measurement, was 0.3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so the uncertainty associated with this measurement is much higher than
 that for the radome-based system.
 The mean difference between the two measurements of heading, averaged over
 flights, had a standard deviation of 0.17

 The resulting heading variable retains the high-frequency response of the
 gust-pod IRU, needed to address issues like wing flex or vibration of the
 pod, but used the higher-quality measurement of heading from the fuselage
 IRU for long-term updating.
 This can improve the measurement of horizontal wind from the gust pod significa
ntly, at the expense of having the measurements use a reference measurement
 outside the instrument.
 If improvement in the measurement of horizontal wind from the gust pod
 becomes important, such processing can be used for special cases.

PITCH:

 The contribution to uncertainty from the measurement of pitch was discussed

Horizontal Velocity Components of the Aircraft:

 The measurement of horizontal wind is the sum of the relative wind and

 components.
 Comparison among the different measurements of velocity components of the
 aircraft ({GGVEW, CVEW_GP, CVEW_LAMS} and {GGVNS, CVNS_GP, CVNS_LAMS})
 indicate that, for DEEPWAVE flights with good IRU operation (flights 5,
 8--14, 16, 20--21, 23--24, 26) the standard deviations among these measurements
 are consistent with an uncertainty of 0.05

For the gust-pod system, the uncertainties in the two components of the
 horizontal wind (lateral and longitudinal relative to the aircraft) are
 quite different.
 For the lateral component of the wind, adding the elemental contributions
 to uncertainty in quadrature leads to a net bias estimate of 0.7
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s and a random uncertainty of 1.7
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 The measurement of heading makes a dominating contribution to each, and
 the values used for these estimates are the result of intercomparisons
 between units and are much higher than the best specifications for the
 unit listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Gust-pod-measurements"

\end_inset

, but as noted there the error can increase fairly significantly if not
 updated with frequent course changes.
 For the longitudinal component, the corresponding results are 0.3 and 0.2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 Here the dominant contribution arises from the corrections applied to dynamic
 pressure to address the measured static defect as determined from calibrations,
 just as for the radome-based system, because the measurements of the longitudin
al component of the wind are the same for both systems.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The radome-based system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard wind measuring system on the GV is called the radome-based
 system and results in the basic wind measurements WDC, WSC, and WIC representin
g the horizontal wind direction (degrees relative to true north), horizontal
 wind speed (m/s) and vertical wind speed (m/s).
 For this system, the estimated bias limit, random component of standard
 uncertainty, and combined standard uncertainty are listed in Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Summary-of-uncertainty"

\end_inset

.
 The combined uncertainty is obtained by adding the estimate of bias and
 the estimate of random error in quadrature, but this characteristic can
 be questioned because the bias estimate does not have normal statistical
 characteristics.
 It is preferable to use the estimates of bias and of the random component
 of standard uncertainty separately when characterizing a measurement.
 As an approximation, it is reasonable to consider about 0.4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s as the uncertainty in each component of the measurement of horizontal
 wind and 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s as the corresponding uncertainty in vertical wind.
 In any specific direction, the uncertainty in horizontal wind remains about
 0.4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, so this is also the uncertainty in measured wind speed.
 Translation to uncertainty in wind direction depends on the magnitude of
 the wind speed: If the wind speed is 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and the uncertainty in the component of the wind transverse to the wind
 speed is 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{u}$
\end_inset

, the uncertainty in wind direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\xi$
\end_inset

 is about 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{u}$
\end_inset

/u.
 For example, for 
\begin_inset Formula $u=20$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{u}=0.4$

\begin_inset Formula $\delta\xi=0.02$

 is applied.
 The improvement in effect removes the bias contribution from pitch, so
 it reduces the estimated bias to 0.05
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s and the standard uncertainty to about 0.06
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 Further reduction would require independent evidence that the calibration
 maneuvers are flown where the average wind is smaller than the 0.05
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s value assumed when obtaining these results, because this then is the
 dominant remaining uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of horizontal wind, the leading uncertainty is that associated
 with heading, which could be improved by implementation of a full Kalman
 filter to adjust the heading or by replacement of the IRU with a higher-quality
 system with inherent Kalman filtering.
 There are systems available with much lower specified uncertainty that
 could reduce the uncertainty in lateral wind significantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The gust-pod system
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vertical wind measured by the gust pod is surprisingly good, when it
 is considered that the measurements are made under the wing of the aircraft
 in a region of seriously distorted airflow.
 While of lesser quality than the measurements from the radome, the measurements
 based on the gust pod have estimated undertainty only about twice that
 of the radome-based measurement.
 On the other hand, the measurements of horizontal wind from the gust pod
 have significantly greater uncertainty than those from the radome.
 The uncertainty approaches 2
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s even in the selected best cases, and there are examples where the discrepanc
y between similar measurements of heading becomes much larger than the tabulated
 values and the associated uncertainty in horizontal wind becomes even larger.
 Vertical and horizontal winds are both problematic in turns and should
 not be used for roll angles exceeding about 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 in magnitude.
 The problem with measurements in turns arises because the gust-pod system
 is not aligned with the longitudinal axis of the aircraft so, in turns,
 the three attitude angles (pitch, roll, heading) become intermixed.
 It may be that the appropriate angle transformations can be found to handle
 this problem, but current processing leads to obvious errors in turns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some support for this value of uncertainty in vertical wind from the gust
 pod was provided by Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:vw-gp-vs-wic"

\end_inset

, where the two measurements of vertical wind were compared for all measurements
 from one flight.
 The standard error in the difference between the two measurements was 0.27
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, while the uncertainties in Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Summary-of-uncertainty"

\end_inset

 would suggest an expected uncertainty in the difference of 0.22
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 While this is slightly lower than the measured difference, some of that
 difference can arise from real differences in vertical wind at the two
 locations on the aircraft and from timing differences, so the measured
 standard error is in reasonable agreement with the expectations from the
 uncertainty analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using measurements of horizontal wind from the gust pod is not recommended.
 That system was designed to provide a back-up measurement that could be
 anti-iced to remain operational in heavy cloud.
 In the case of vertical wind, it appears that the system fills this back-up
 roll well.
 However, the horizontal wind from the gust pod is much inferior to that
 from the radome-based system and probably should be used only with much
 caution.
 That would involve checking that the measurement of heading from the gust-pod
 IRU provides measurements in reasonable agreement with other units, considering
 installation differences in orientation) and excluding turns.
 An additional restriction arises from the fit restrictions used to determine
 the coefficients in the equation representing angle of attack.
 Those restrictions were: true airspeed (TASF) greater than 130
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, absolute value of roll less than 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and altitude greater than 5000
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m.
 Outside these limits, extrapolation errors can lead to significant errors
 in the measurements from the gust pod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The straightforward way to improve the measurements from the gust pod would
 be to improve the measurement of heading.
 It might be possible to calculate a surrogate heading from the fuselage
 IRU and the known installation offset of the gust-pod IRU, but this hasn't
 been investigated yet and would require continued study beyond that reported
 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first three lines in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Summary-of-uncertainty"

\end_inset

 claim that wind can be measured with low uncertainty from a high-speed
 aircraft such as the NCAR/NSF GV.
 This is particularly challenging at high speed because the aircraft introduces
 flow distortions and pressure variations over and near the fuselage that
 affect many of the sensors used to measure wind.
 Calibration by comparison to a laser air-motion sensor has led to improvement
 in the measurement of horizontal wind and is the basis for achieving these
 tolerances.
 Calibration maneuvers, especially those involving flying circles, have
 provided evidence for the claimed limits to uncertainty and have refined
 some of the calibrations used to achieve these limits.
 The fourth line in the table indicates disappointing performance for the
 gust-pod measurement of the component of horizontal wind lateral to the
 aircraft, so in general this measurement should not be used for research
 without further improvement.
 However, the measurement` of vertical wind from the gust pod provides a
 useful back-up to the conventional measurement.

 after reprocessing so a separate archive is maintained for this document.
 The data files in this archive represent R data.frames and are preserved
 as binary-format 'Rdata' files via R 'save' commands.
 The code in the GitHub archive has appropriate 'load' commands to ingest
 these data files from a subdirectory named 'Data' but this is not part
 of the GitHub repository because it is too large to be appropriate there.
 To reproduce this research, those data files have to be transferred separately
 from the NCAR HPSS to the 'Data' directory.

Extensive use has been made of attributes assigned to the data.frames and
 the variables in those data.frames.
 All the attributes from the original netCDF files have been transferred,
 so there is a record of how the original data were processed, for example
 recording calibration coefficients and processing chains for the variables.
 Once the data.frames are loaded into R, these attributes can be viewed and
 provide additional documentation of what data were used.
 Key information like the processing date, the program version, and the
 selection of primary variables is thus preserved.
