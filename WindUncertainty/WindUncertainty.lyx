Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Wind is the motion of the atmosphere relative to the Earth.
 Most reseearch aircraft have the capability to measure wind, and these
 measurements have many uses in research projects using aircraft.
 They help define the flow and so provide context for other measurements,
 and they are often used to study fluxes of atmospheric constituents, turbulence
, wave motions, cloud updrafts and downdrafts, convergence and divergence,
 and many other topics.
 They can provide important information transferred to models for data assimilat
ion or for validation tests of model results.

 or simply the GV.
 Its range and endurance makes it possible to measure wind over large distances
 and so to characterize mesoscale and even larger features in the atmosphere.
 However, its high speed (typically Mach 0.8, or about 240

 is as follows.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 describes the components of the wind-measuring system in more detail, with
 examples of the measurements and information on the specifications for
 the sensors involved.
 Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:CalProcedures"

\end_inset

 then describes how the measurements are monitored in routine use and the
 calibration procedures that are employed with the sensors.
 It also describes how some needed empirical relationships are obtained
 and checked.
 That section is followed by a summary of the uncertainty in wind measurements
 (Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Uncertainty-components"

\end_inset

), with a tabulation of individual error sources and many references to
 other parts of the document where studies have led to estimates of limits
 on those error sources.
 It is our hope that this section will provide a summary of the results
 that can either stand alone or provide a guide to the further information
 in this report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of the subsequent sections provides information used to assess uncertainty.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Calibrations"

\end_inset

 describes how the key gust measurements have been calibrated, tested, and
 intercompared.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:vertical-wind"

\end_inset

 discusses the choice of measurement to represent the vertical motion of
 the aircraft and some aspects of the uncertainty in that measurement, the
 relative timing of acquisition of the measurements entering vertical wind,
 and a procedure for detecting the Schuler oscillation in the pitch measurement
 and applying a correction that reduces the uncertainty in that measurement
 that, uncorrected, accounts for the dominant uncertainty in vertical wind.
 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:HWind"

\end_inset

 then uses drifting or Lagrangian circle maneuvers to establish limits on
 some critical components entering measurement of the horizontal wind, the
 true airspeed and offsets in heading and sideslip angle, which account
 for some of the bias limits used in Sect.

, and it describes how the measurements of ground-speed components from
 the inertial units and GPS units have been combined to reduce uncertainty
 in the components of the horizontal wind.
 Appendix B presents some of the characteristics of turbulence measurements,
 including variance spectra and potential to measure fluxes, and notes some
 limitations of such measurements.
 Appendix C provides a discussion of reproducibility of this document, with
 links to the programs and data used to generate this report.
 There is also an index at the end of the report.
 At the end of the document there is a list of symbols, list of variable
 names from NCAR/EOL/RAF aircraft data files that are used in this report

There is potential confusion arising from the signs of yaw and sideslip.
 The terms have different meaning and opposite sign conventions.
 Yaw refers to the orientation of the aircraft about an axis perpendicular
 to the longitudinal and lateral axes (i.e., upward when level), and it increases
 as the nose moves to starboard.
 Sideslip refers to the direction of the relative wind, and it is positive
 if the relative wind is from the starboard side.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An additional correction is applied to account for the effect of the rotation
 rate of the aircraft on the measurements.
 This correction is needed when the reference unit for motion relative to
 the Earth, the IRU, is separated from the measurement of relative wind
 on the radome or gust pod.
 For the gust pod, this is negligible because the IRU is co-located with
 the gust-measuring system.
 See the cited reference for details.

 0.015
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 These are strap-down ring laser gyro micro inertial systems.

The calculation of true airspeed from measured dynamic and static pressure

 from dry-air values when water vapor is present in significant amounts.
 This correction is usually insignificant for dew-point temperatures below

 The correction to true airspeed is approximately a factor of (1+0.3

 uncertainty in the measured humidity.The dewpoint measurements become more
 uncertain than listed here at the low end of this range, but the humidity
 correction is insignificant there.
 They are likely better than listed here for the upper range, in level flight,

.
 The large difference in pitch is a result of the gust pod being installed
 in a canister below the wing where it points downward by several degrees
 relative to the aircraft longitudinal axis.
 (The pods were designed this way to provide better approaching airflow
 for cloud-imaging probes and other sampling from the airstream.) There is
 also a significant difference in heading and in roll for similar reasons.

 of differential pressure at the radome and the resulting angle of attack
 and sideslip angle calculated from those pressure differences.
 The calculation is described in Section 4 of this document.
 Fluctuations in sideslip angle are seldom more than a fraction of a degree,
 while there can be several-degree fluctuations in the angle of attack.
 The gradual decrease in angle of attack is a result of the change in fuel
 load on the aircraft, which requires a smaller angle of attack to keep
 the aircraft level as the weight becomes smaller.

The last set of components entering the measurement of wind consists of

 long-term drift) and the GPS measurements (having long-term accuracy but
 inferior short-term response) are combined in the measurement of wind.
 In addition to the Schuler oscillation, additional perturbations associated
 with turns result from the mixing of pitch, roll, and heading errors when
 the aircraft is banked.

 It was still regarded as experimental for that project, but performed well
 as documented in this document, so it is now ready for deployment as a
 requestable instrument.
 The system has also been called the all-weather wind pod because the primary
 reason for its development was to provide a backup wind measurement for
 cases when the radome system was not available, including times when it
 was blocked by ice or frozen water in the pressure lines.
 The gust pod fits into a standard

 Some contribution would be expected from vibrations and wing flex that
 affect the gust pod, so these comparisons are good support for the approximate
 validity of the specifications.
 However, the feedback from the Kalman filter using GPS measurements can
 be ineffective in the absence of turns or maneuvers, so some of the specified
 uncertainties, esp.

for heading, can be exceeded significantly in the absence of maneuvers,

 However, the Rosemount 858 probe is located under the wing in a location
 where there is significant airflow distortion, so these measurements often
 differ from the measurements from the static buttons on the fuselage by
 10--20
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

hPa and significant corrections are needed if these measurements are to
 be used for pressure measurements.
 With the gust-pod, the use is as a reference for the differential measurement
 of dynamic pressure because the dynamic-pressure transducer is connected
 between the total-pressure port on the front of the 858 probe and the static
 ports.
 No calibration has been determined that would make this measurement useful
 as a measure of true ambient pressure, although that could be done by fitting
 to match the standard static pressure.
 In the absence of such a correction, PS_GP should not be considered an
 alternate measurement of ambient pressure.
 The use of this measurement to determine an alternate measure of true airspeed
 will be discussed in Section

 The measurement is the pressure difference between the forward-pointing
 port on the Rosemount 858 probe and the static ports on the side of that
 probe.
 Because the system is located under the wing in a region of disturbed airflow,
 the dynamic pressure requires unconventional correction to obtain the airspeed,
 as discussed in Sect.

 The two measurements match quite well in regard to the structure of these
 waves and the amplitudes of the fluctuations.
 The measurements of horizontal wind speed are in similar agreement, but
 the wind direction for this period shows an offset for the gust pod measurement
 relative to the conventional measurement, varying from about 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 near the start of this period to about 1
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 near the end.
 This is a result of an apparent error in heading from the C-MIGITS IRU,
 a common feature to see near the start of flights but one that usually
 was made smaller during flight by the action of the GPS updating via Kalman
 filter in that unit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of this error in wind direction and the problems with measured
 heading for flight exactly southbound complicate the use of the measurements
 of horizontal wind from the gust pod and make them of lesser quality that
 the standard measurements.
 Fortunately, in this and most projects, the horizontal-wind measurements
 are available from the radome-based system on all flights and are usually
 not compromised even when there is loss of the measurement of angle of
 attack from plugging of the lines in the radome, because the side-mounted
 ports for the measurement of sideslip seldom are plugged.

Figure

 shows the high-rate variance spectra from the two systems.
 There is a significant difference at frequencies above about 3 Hz, with
 the gust-pod distribution dropping faster and the standard wind WIC showing
 more variance.
 The high frequency spectrum from the gust pod may be more realistic; it
 is unusual to see high variance at these frequencies without a related
 generating source.
 The coherence between the radome and gust-pod measurements was above 0.9
 for frequencies less than 1 Hz but then fell to around 0.2 at 10 Hz.
 This is an indication that the two measurements are different in important
 ways at high frequency.
 This would not be the case if they were responding with different amplitudes;
 the signals must really be mostly incoherent at the highest frequency.
 The separation wing-to-fuselage is about 7 m lateral and 13 m longitudinal,
 so that doesn't seem enough to cause the low high-frequency coherence.
 The phase changes from in-phase at frequencies less than 1 Hz to 180
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 out-of-phase at 9 Hz, with WIG lagging, so this is consistent with the
 longitudinal offset.
 Shifting WIG relative to WIC also gave maximum coherence when WIG was shifted
 forward 1/25 s.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
gust pod!problem in turns
\end_layout

\end_inset

The attitude angles (pitch, roll, heading) as measured by the gust-pod IRU
 are defined relative to the orientation of the inertial unit in the gust
 pod, which is aligned a few degrees from the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
 The canisters on the GV are oriented with axis pointing inward and downward
 relative to the aircraft longitudinal axis, in order to align with normal
 airflow at the pods.
 This is desirable for hydrometeor sampling and minimum drag, but it complicates
 the calculation of wind because roll introduced in turns, primarily a rotation
 about the aircraft longitudinal axis, will appear as a combination of attitude-
angle changes in the gust pod.
 Errors arising from the initial alignment at the start of flights will
 also cause problems with the measured attitude angles, and it is likely
 that these will be more significant near the start of flights because the
 built-in Kalman filter uses GPS measurements to correct such errors in
 the course of the flight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This problem with the reference frame for attitude angles has two consequences:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Measurements from the gust pod in turns have large errors in comparison
 to the errors in level flight.
 The measurements from the gust pod should probably be flagged as of poor
 quality whenever the roll exceeds some threshold like perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm5^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 The measurements usually look reasonable in turns despite this worry, but
 the largest errors occur there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There may be an offset introduced by the mixing of sideslip and angle of
 attack, arising from the difference in roll angle, and this will affect
 the reference or average value of the measured vertical wind.
 Some flights (e.g., DEEPWAVE
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
DEEPWAVE!flight 18
\end_layout

\end_inset

 flight 18) have a significant offset in vertical wind from the gust pod
 at the start of the flight that is related to offsets in heading and roll,
 gradually corrected in the course of the flight via the C-MIGITSIII IRU
 Kalman filter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the weight of the aircraft decreases during the flight, so does
 the angle of attack.
 When the wing flexes, the measured sideslip at the gust pod also varies
 with weight of the aircraft.
 This change in sideslip causes an offset in the mean lateral component
 of the wind as measured by the gust-pod system.

These effects suggest that the vertical wind measured by the gust pod may
 have an offset in some cases, particularly at the start of flights, and
 the measurement of sideslip can also have an offset that will contribute
 to the lateral component of the measured wind.
 These are weaknesses in the measurements from the gust pod that, at this
 stage, do not appear easily corrected.
 A future study implementing Schuler tuning in a post-processing step and
 correcting for the entwined-angle effects may be able to reduce these weaknesse
s, but that will require continued analysis not performed for this report.

 The angle

 the angle between the beam and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x^{\prime}}$

 is the rotation angle about 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x^{\prime}}$

 axis.
 This geometry is designed for GV installation where the LAMS pod is installed
 on the left wing, outboard pylon, outboard position.
 The pointing geometry relative to the aircraft may change based on the
 installation configuration on the C-130 (to be determined on ARISTO in
 fall 2015) where the LAMS optical fiber are routed to the aircraft right

Relative Beam Pointing

The relative pointing of the LAMS beams is defined by the orientation of
 each beam relative to the others.
 If the absolute pointing direction of one beam is known, the relative pointing
 may be used to determine the absolute pointing of all other beams.
 We define the relative pointing coordinates such that the z-axis is directed
 along the forward beam (D).

Two methods were used to determine the relative pointing angles.
 The first, performed prior to IDEAS-4-GV, used a Laser Survey, in which
 a commercial laser surveying

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 company measured the positions of the LAMS head and the beam focal points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second method used a 30x beam expanded with focusing lens in a fixed
 position (referred to here as the receiver system) while LAMS was mounted
 in an astronomical telescope mount.
 A camera was placed at the focal point of the receiver system and the telescope
 mount was used to steer the LAMS beams into the receiver system such that
 each beam was centered on the CCD.
 This method had redundant pointing measurements, using both SDN500 data
 as well as the telescope mount angle read-outs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both methods were relatively accurate, with less than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.2^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 difference in beam pointing.
 It should be noted that the fibers on the LAMS head may have moved slightly
 between the two measurement methods.
 The forward pointing beam was added after IDEAS-4-GV which required some
 disassembly of the LAMS head.
 So the relatively small difference in beam pointing may be partially attributab
le to that work.

Prior to IDEAS-4-GV in Sept.--Oct.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2013, a laser survey system was used to estimate the LAMS beam pointing
 angles of Beams 1, 2, and 3 (the forward pointing beam had not been added
 at that point).
 The LAMS head was positioned in the hanger so the bottom two beams were
 approximately parallel to the floor.
 Two IR card targets were placed at the focal points of those beams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The laser survey system locked onto a corner cube reflector and register
 its position in space.
 The corner cube was first used to estimate the position of the LAMS exit
 ports by taking a series of points around their circumference.
 The tracker then registered the positions of the IR card targets by the
 same method.
 Once complete, the LAMS head was rotated by 
\begin_inset Formula $120^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and the process was repeated.
 This measurement was repeated for three different LAMS head rotations,
 where two beams were surveyed at a time.

 to provide a best fit for the beam pointing.

The relative positions of the LAMS system can be determined by defining
 a fixed reference vector and directing each beam onto it.
 The pointing of the LAMS module is recorded when each beam is directed
 on the reference.
 Without absolute knowledge of the reference vector, this only allows the
 relative beam geometry to be determined.
 Thus, we define a LAMS beam pointing coordinate frame such that the z-axis
 is along the forward beam.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The telescope beam measurement system was developed in house to provide
 position insensitive angular measurement.
 It uses a 30x beam expander consisting of an off axis parabola and convex
 secondary (exact type is unknown).
 The light from that beam expander is focused onto an IR card using a 50
 mm lens, yielding a total focal length of 1.5 m.
 The IR card was then reimaged using a 45 mm lens onto a CCD to monitor
 the beam position (see Figure

To determine the beam pointing angle, we invert the rotation operations
 (or perform the opposite rotations in the opposite order), which results
 in 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{u}=\mathbf{R}(-\varphi_{T},\hat{y})\mathbf{R}(-\vartheta_{T},\hat{x})\hat{r}.\label{TelMountBeam}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

To obtain a beam pointing vector, we first need to know the reference vector
 in some coordinate basis.
 We let Beam 4 (the forward pointing beam) define the z-axis in this coordinate
 basis and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}$
\end_inset

 by evaluating Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "TelMountReference"

\end_inset

 for the recorded Alt/Az angles of Beam 4 (D) where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
0 & 0 & 1\end{array}\right]^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 We then obtain all other beam vectors from their respective Alt/Az coordinates
 using Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process for obtaining the beam pointing vectors from the SDN500 IRU
 is essentially identical to the process above, except that the SDN500 IRU
 provides roll, pitch and heading.
 It should be noted, as will be addressed later, that the SDN500 IRU heading
 is not reliable when the device is stationary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the pointing angles of the beams are obtained from the telescope mount
 and SDN500 IRU, the pointing angles need to be compared.
 However, the beam vectors are recorded in different coordinate frames and
 SDN500 IRU heading data cannot be treated as reliable.
 A transformation matrix between these two frames and heading adjustments
 to SDN500 IRU are determined using minimization of errors so we can compare
 the beam pointing results.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:AngleDiff"

\end_inset

 shows the difference in angle between each of the four beams after optimizing
 the transformation between the two coordinate frames.
 The two beam pointing measurements give results that are quite close.

\begin_layout Standard
An assessment of the beam pointing accuracy was performed by translating
 the focused beam across the IR card and finding the spread of angles accepted
 by the optical system.
 The full angle field-of-view of the system was approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 or about 
\begin_inset Formula $0.02^{\circ}$
\end_inset

.
 The beam spot position can be repeated to greater accuracy than this (we
 can see when it is well centered using the CCD), however this is probably
 a reasonable uncertainty figure because the IR card may not be located
 at the exact Fourier plane of the optical system.

 are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All four beams are measured without changes to the setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The measurement is "hands off", so there is very little risk of perturbing
 the system during the measurement processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The process provides redundant angle measurements (SDN500 IRU and the telescope
 mount).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The entire LAMS pod is used and referenced directly to the same SDN500 INS
 used in flight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The weaknesses of this method are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Beam focal positions are not measured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Setup and alignment of the system is time consuming (approximately 2 days).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The procedure still does not provide an absolute pointing measurement because
 the telescope acceptance vector is not known.

\begin_layout Standard
The following uncertainty analysis treats unknown biases in pointing as
 random variables with standard deviations or variances.
 These figures represent uncertainty, not stochastic processes.
 The resultant variances provide bounds on the LAMS wind vector accuracy
 based strictly on the instrument characterization, independent of other
 factors such as signal fidelity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The accuracy to which we know the LAMS relative beam pointing directly impacts
 our estimates of airspeed and wind.
 A sequence of line-of-sight velocity measurements is given by the equation:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\vec{m}=\mathbf{U}\vec{v}_{L},\label{Vmeas}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{m}$
\end_inset

 is the set of measurements (3 or 4 elements corresponding to the number
 of beams in use), 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{L}$
\end_inset

 is the air velocity vector in the LAMS beam coordinate basis and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix describing each beam's pointing angle given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{U}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\hat{u}_{1} & \hat{u}_{2} & \hat{u}_{3} & \hat{u}_{4}\end{array}\right]^{T},\label{Umatrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $ith$
\end_inset

 beam pointing direction.
 The exact vector entries for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{U}$
\end_inset

 are dependent on which beams are used for LAMS operation.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}_{4}$
\end_inset

 would not be included for HCR-TEST (post-DEEPWAVE configuration) where
 the down-inboard beam was not used in that three beam configuration.
 For this analysis the beam and air velocity vectors are defined in the
 LAMS relative coordinate frame.
 Though this is not inherently required, it allows the analysis presented
 in this section to flow directly into further uncertainty analysis described
 in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Absolute"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The covariance matrix of a beam pointing vector is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Sigma_{\hat{u}_{i}}^{2}=\left(\frac{\partial\hat{u}_{i}}{\partial\phi}\right)\sigma_{\phi}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial\hat{u}_{i}}{\partial\phi}\right)^{T}+\left(\frac{\partial\hat{u}_{i}}{\partial\theta}\right)\sigma_{\theta}^{2}\left(\frac{\partial\hat{u}_{i}}{\partial\theta}\right)^{T},\label{CovUvec}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\phi}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 are the standard deviation of the beam pointing angles.
 Note that the uncertainty in these angles may be different for each beam,
 but this analysis will treat them as identical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variance in a measurement due to beam pointing uncertainty is given
 by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{m_{ii}}^{2}=\vec{v}_{L}^{T}\Sigma_{\hat{u}_{i}}^{2}\vec{v}_{L}.\label{measUncert}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The uncertainty in the relative pointing angles are assumed to be independent
 for each beam (common uncertainty in the instrument pointing will be addressed
 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Absolute"

\end_inset

).
 Thus the total measurement covariance matrix is diagonal and given by 
\begin_inset Formula

Assuming the angle uncertainty of all four beams is approximately

 and an aircraft velocity of 200 m/s along the LAMS pointing direction,
 the total velocity uncertainty resulting from beam pointing uncertainty
 is approximately 0.06 m/s in the horizontal and vertical directions with

\begin_layout Standard
With the relative pointing angles of the beams, an air velocity vector can
 be retrieved reliably in the predefined LAMS coordinate frame.
 However, the exact transformation between the LAMS beams and the SDN500
 IRU coordinate frame (defined by the unit's principal axes) is unknown.
 We typically assume that one SDN500 IRU axis is exactly aligned to the
 forward pointing beam and one is directed along the angle beam 1.
 However, it stands to reason that there will be some slight differences
 between the LAMS beam coordinate frame and the principal axes of the SDN500
 IRU.
 At present, the only method we have for determining this transformation
 relies on making small angle adjustments based on flight maneuvers.

Initial operation of the three beam LAMS on IDEAS-4-GV revealed that the
 aircraft can influence flow fields in the LAMS sample volume.
 This issue became recognizable when data processing showed the down-inboard
 beam registered significantly slower velocities than the other two beams.
 An analysis using Gulfstream's computational fluid dynamics analysis confirmed
 that all three beams could be expected to observe some flow distortion.
 The expected flow distortion depends on the aircraft flight parameters.
 The down-inboard beam is expected to experience the largest effect, typically
 observing a line-of-sight flow effect between -0.5 and -2.0 m/s when the
 beam is focused at 20 m.
 The upward beam may see flow effects on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.5$
\end_inset

 m/s and the down-outboard may see flow effects between 0 and -0.5 m/s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the GV, LAMS no longer uses the down-inboard beam due to the substantial
 flow effects in its sample volume.

The output from the inertial sensors is monitored primarily by comparison
 to other similar units.
 The duplicate Honeywell inertial systems are compared on each flight to
 ensure that their performance remains consistent, and when present the
 gust-pod and LAMS inertial systems are also compared to each other and
 to the Honeywell systems.
 The alignment angles of the various inertial systems have been determined
 by survey and are not expected to change.
 Ground-speed measurements from the inertial systems are compared routinely
 to GPS measurements of ground speed, and the Schuler oscillations in ground-spe
ed components are monitored as indicators of the quality of these measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Errors in the pitch measurement from the Honeywell inertial system will
 result in errors in ground-speed components, so the differences between
 inertial-system and GPS measurements of ground-speed components can be
 used as indicators of the quality of the measurement of pitch.

 This measurement is useful for two reasons.
 First if it may be desirable to obtain measurements of wind from the gust
 pod without reference to the usual radome-based system, for redundancy,
 backup, and quality control.
 Second, the gust pod provides high-frequency measurements

 and the airspeed measurement.
 The drift of the aircraft in such a maneuver provides a good reference
 measurement of the wind that is independent of all wind-sensing components
 on the aircraft except the GPS.
 In addition, a plot of measured wind speed as a function of the angle between
 the heading of the aircraft and the wind direction is a very useful analysis
 tool because any error in true airspeed will produce a difference from
 upwind to downwind flight while any error in the combination of heading
 and sideslip angle will produce a difference between the two portions of
 the circle that are crosswind.
 Furthermore, the sideslip angle should have opposite sign in right-turn
 circles vs.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

left-turn circles, so this makes it possible to separate a bias in the measureme
nt of heading from a bias in the measurement of sideslip angle.

 The circles provide good evidence in support of the low uncertainty claimed

 the measurements of heading and sideslip angle.

 many of the potential errors from sensors are removed by the calibrations
 in this section, so the calibration becomes the central factor affecting
 the final uncertainty.
 Other intermediate sections discuss some specific tests applied to the
 measurements in order to check or reduce the uncertainty limits associated
 with these measurements.
 This report goes somewhat beyond a conventional analysis of uncertainty

\begin_layout Standard
Because three wind-measuring systems are characterized in this report, they
 will be discussed separately.
 However, the standard system is the radome-based system, so that will be
 treated in the most depth.
 The other two systems, the under-wing gust pod and the LAMS, are new systems
 and their characteristics are still being developed and explored, so their
 discussion necessarily will be incomplete until additional flight data
 are collected.

 For application to straight-and-level flight (or flight where the intent
 is to remain level), simplified equations suffice for evaluation of the
 error terms.
 Evaluation of the more general case will not be considered here and will
 likely benefit from Monte Carlo approaches.

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The error in pitch arises from measurements from the IRU and is affected
 mostly by an initial offset during alignment and then further changes in
 this error arising from the Schuler oscillation and from accelerations
 that affect this error.
 The error in angle of attack, on the other hand, arises from a combination
 of measurement error from the pressure transducers and error in the formula
 used to deduce angle of attack from the pressure measurements.
 This error is not independent of the error in pitch, however, because the
 calibration as presented in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Calibration-AOA"

\end_inset

 relies on the measured difference between pitch and angle of attack being
 zero when the vertical wind and vertical aircraft motion are zero.
 Thus any bias in pitch is transferred to a bias in angle of attack, so
 this component of the error in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:delta-w-sq-simplified"

\end_inset

 should cancel.
 The remaining errors arise from sources that are independent and likely
 uncorrelated, so the middle term on the right side of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:delta-w-sq-simplified"

\end_inset

 will be neglected in this preliminary analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to estimate the magnitudes of these errors from measurements.
 Because the GV instrumentation includes two identical inertial systems,
 the difference in measurements of pitch from those two systems provides
 one lower-bound estimate of the uncertainty in pitch.
 Measurements discussed in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 0.3
\begin_inset space ~

 Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sub:Schuler"

\end_inset

 presents additional evidence from evaluation of the Schuler coupling between
 pitch or roll errors and ground-speed errors, also indicating that typical
 pitch errors are of about this magnitude.
 This is significantly smaller than the manufacturer's specified uncertainty
 for this instrument, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.05^{\circ}$

\begin_layout Paragraph
Horizontal wind
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Errors in measurements affect the longitudinal and lateral components of
 the horizontal wind in different ways.
 For the longitudinal component (along the aircraft longitudinal axis),
 the relative-wind measurement (essentially the true airspeed) has been
 calibrated by comparison to measurements of the single-beam LAMS, leading
 to an estimated standard uncertainty of about 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s (Cooper et al., 2014).
 The LAMS measurement is based on measurement of the Doppler shift and thus
 has low limits for bias and precision, dependent primarily on the uncertainty
 associated with determining the peak in the returned Doppler spectrum in
 the presence of turbulence.
 The lateral component is measured using the sideslip angle, which is determined
 in a manner similar to that used to calibrate the measurement of angle
 of attack.
 However, the zero reference angle for attack is determined well by assuming
 that, on average in quiescent air, the vertical wind should be zero.
 No similar reference angle exists for sideslip, and trim adjustments to
 the aircraft can change the mean sideslip angle, so a different procedure
 with additional sources of uncertainty must be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two maneuvers are particularly effective for determining the zero reference
 for sideslip angle (at which angle the lateral horizontal component of
 the relative wind would be zero): (i) Reverse-heading maneuvers,
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
maneuver!reverse heading
\end_layout

\end_inset

 where a straight leg is flown for a short time (typically 2 min), then
 the aircraft reverses heading and flies back along the reverse heading,
 with the result that the wind component perpendicular to the longitudinal
 axis of the aircraft should reverse sign; or (ii) constant-bank circles
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
maneuver!circle
\end_layout

\end_inset

 flown drifting with the wind, for which the lateral component of the wind
 should exhibit a sinusoidal variation around the circle reflecting a possible
 heading and/or sideslip error.
 Both maneuvers can provide a reference for correcting a combination of
 heading and sideslip errors, and the circle maneuver provides a mechanism
 for determining the sideslip error alone, as discussed in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 There the uncertainty associated with the bias in sideslip was indicated
 to be about 0.06
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 and the random uncertainty in heading was estimated to be less than 0.09
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The slope in the high-frequency region does not match that expected for
 a white-noise signal, for which the variance would be constant and in these
 plots, where the spectral density is multiplied by the frequency, the plotted
 line should increase linearly with frequency parallel to the orange dashed
 lines.
 Instead, the spectrum for BDIFR has smaller slope than this, looking perhaps
 as if the spectrum starts out at a point where a white-noise spectrum with
 standard deviation 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

hPa would be appropriate, but then is filtered or otherwise smoothed
\begin_inset Foot

perhaps by the response in the lines connecting the ports to the pressure

\end_layout

\end_inset

 so that at the high-frequency limit the equivalent white-noise standard
 deviation would be 0.05
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

hPa.
 The spectrum for SSLIP looks similarly filtered, with an equivalent white-noise
 spectrum somewhere in the range of 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, similar to that characterizing AKRD.
 However, the estimated uncertainty in the bias for the combined effects
 of sideslip angle and heading was, from the circle analysis, 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.09^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and these lead to contributions to the uncertainty in bias of the lateral
 wind of about 0.3
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s.
 The horizontal wind thus has an asymmetrical estimated uncertainty, about
 three times as large for the lateral component as for the longitudinal
 component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like vertical wind, this uncertainty estimate for the horizontal wind needs
 to be refined for application to the Earth-relative wind by consideration
 of the uncertainty in the determination of sensitivity coefficients for
 sideslip angle and other contributions to the net uncertainty in wind.

 The uncertainty is assigned to bias because it is likely a calibration
 uncertainty and the resolution and stability are much smaller than this
 bias.
 However, a calibration bias in this measurement does not affect the final
 wind measurement because the procedure in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 determines the angle of attack from flight data in a way that can be considered
 a calibration of the measurement of angle of attack, and a bias in ADIFR
 would be reflected in a change in sensitivity coefficients determined in
 that section that would compensate for that bias.
 Only random errors in ADIFR would propagate to the final measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, and such errors are thought to be negligible, so the propagated error
 for ADIFR is listed as negligible.

 It is important, though, that the calibration is dependent on the assumption
 that the mean vertical wind where the calibration data were collected be
 zero.
 This is discussed in Sect.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 There is no independent way to check this except by comparing results from
 different regions as done in this report.
 That remains a major weakness in calibration and is the major contributor
 to uncertainty in angle of attack, but it introduces a bias arising from
 a possible calibration error.
 Fluctuations from the mean value are measured with uncertainty a factor
 of ten smaller than this bias.
 The assumed mean value of the vertical wind leading to this bias was

 In that section, it was estimated that the standard error in pitch is 0.02

\end_inset

 and that this is primarily in the form of a slowly varying error that,
 over measurement periods short compared to the Schuler oscillation period

 The correction procedure represented by Eq.

 so the bias entry in Table

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 can be eliminated by application of that algorithm.
 The partitioning between bias and random uncertainty depends on the interval
 considered, because Schuler precession will cause variation in this error
 with the Schuler-oscillation period of about 84 min.
 For periods long compared to this the error will have the character of
 a random-error component, so using 0.08
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s would be appropriate for random uncertainty of such long-term measurements
 while the bias should be reduced substantially, perhaps to 0.02
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

 For periods small compared to the Schuler period, the pitch error appears
 as a bias and there is a much smaller random error, evaluated in Sect.

 This is the usual case for measurements of interest, so the bias and random
 errors are partitioned as appropriate for this case in the table.
 The uncertainty in pitch is the leading contributor to the standard uncertainty
 in vertical wind and is also the leading contributor to the overall estimate
 of bias.

 comparable to the contributions from pitch and angle of attack.
 The error in aircraft vertical speed is likely a mixture of bias and random
 error, because the primary source is uncertainty in ionospheric corrections
 which will be persistent for important parts of flights but likely to change
 at least from flight to flight.
 Because of the likely persistence of the error, it is assigned here primarily
 to bias.

 Evaluation at typical values shows that the dependence of measured vertical
 wind on uncertainty in this variable is negligible.

 Temperature is needed to calculate the true airspeed, but as for ambient
 pressure the effect of uncertainty in temperature is very small.
 This was tested as for PSF by evaluating at representative points.
 A representative result was that the listed bias in temperature would lead
 to a bias in airspeed of about 0.05%, leading to a similar percentage change
 in the value of the vertical wind.
 This is negligible in comparison to other sources of uncertainty.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 It was necessary to use additional terms to obtain a good fit in this case,
 but the final result provided a very good representation of the data, as
 good as in the radome case.
 We have therefore used the same uncertainty estimate as for the radome,
 although with less justification and study.
 As for the radome, the dominant source of bias is again the uncertainty
 in vertical wind in the calibration region, which is the same for this
 data set as for that used to determine the radome sensitivity coefficients,
 so this estimate remains the same as for the radome.
 The uncertainties also propagate to the vertical wind in the same way.
 However, the restriction to low roll angle (less than 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 from vertical) is still more important in the case of the gust pod because
 the CMIGITS IRU used with the gust pod is not aligned with the aircraft
 longitudinal axis but rather is mounted in an under-wing pod that was designed
 to point into the airflow and therefore slightly inward relative to the
 longitudinal axis.
 That causes significant problems in turns because the IRU rotates in ways
 that mix the attitude angles.

Two measurements are listed because both are used in the calculation of
 vertical wind.
 QC_GP is used with ADIF_GP to determine the angle of attack, and the calibratio
n described with item 2 effectively replaces uncertainty in this measurement
 with uncertainty in the sensitivity coefficients.
 However, true airspeed is determined using QCF because the conventional
 true airspeed is thought to be superior to the new value determined solely
 from the gust pod (Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:GP-TAS"

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, the effect of uncertainty in QCF on vertical wind is the same
 as that for the radome because the same calculated true airspeed is used
 for both.

The standard deviation in the difference between two variables is actually
 
\begin_inset Formula $sqrt(2)\times\delta$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is the standard deviation in each variable, so a better estimate is 0.04;
 this correction has not been made throughout this document.
\end_layout

\end_inset

As for the radome, a true bias in this measurement (e.g., from misalignment
 at installation) has been subsumed by the calibration of item 2 so does
 not enter in this item.
 However, the remaining error on most flights has a slowly varying component
 (consistent with the long time period of the Schuler oscillation) and so
 appears as a bias for any measurement made over a period short compared
 to the Schuler oscillation, so it appears appropriate to assign the observed
 standard deviation primarily to a bias because it will appear steady in
 normal applications that look at vertical wind over periods short compared
 to the Schuler oscillation.
 We have therefore partitioned the standard deviation into estimated components
 of 0.04
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 bias and 
\begin_inset Formula $0.02^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 random error.
 The uncertainty in pitch is the leading contributor to the standard uncertainty
 in vertical wind and is also the leading contributor to the overall estimate
 of bias.

For the gust pod, the measurement of vertical motion of the aircraft must
 be that from the IRU mounted in the under-wing pod because the wing can
 flex and vibrate and the aircraft can roll in ways that cause that vertical
 motion to differ from that sensed in the cabin.
 Again, comparing the two units mounted in side-by-side wing pods provides
 the best indication of the random component of uncertainty in this measurement,
 because both units experience almost identical vertical motion.
 These two units measure project-mean vertical aircraft motions that differ
 by 0.04
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, with standard deviation in that difference of 0.07
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 It seems reasonable then to estimate the random component of uncertainty
 as 0.07
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, but the bias is more uncertain.
 Good flights usually produced mean vertical aircraft motion from takeoff
 to landing of less than 0.005
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, so it is reasonable to neglect the possible bias in this measurement
 (which is updated for stability in the IRU using pressure altitude as a
 reference).

BDIFR

\end_inset

The primary uncertainty in BDIFR is assigned to bias because it is likely
 a calibration uncertainty and the resolution and stability are much smaller
 than this bias.
 However, a calibration bias in this measurement does not affect the final
 wind measurement because the procedure in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 determines the sideslip angle from flight data in a way that can be considered
 a calibration of the measurement of sideslip angle, and a bias in BDIFR
 would be reflected in a change in sensitivity coefficients determined in
 that section that would compensate for that bias.
 Only random errors in BDIFR propagate to the final measurement of horizontal
 wind, and the effect of the listed random error is typically less than
 0.0001 m/s in lateral wind, with even smaller contribution to the longitudinal
 wind.
 These contributions therefore are listed as negligible in the table.
 The next item considers the determination of sensitivity coefficient for
 sideslip angle and is the dominant contribution to uncertainty in horizontal
 wind arising from the measurement of sideslip angle.

 Application of the calibration procedure based on comparison to the laser

) led to an estimated standard uncertainty of 0.1

m/s for steady flight conditions and 0.3
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s for fluctuating conditions, so this is used for the table entry pertaining
 to the wind component in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the
 aircraft.
 For the lateral component, QCF affects the calculated sideslip angle SSRD,
 but as in the case of AKRD the procedure to determine sensitivity coefficients
 removes any effect of bias in QCF by calibration in terms of the coefficients
 {
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0},\,c_{1}$
\end_inset

} so a potential bias in QCF does not enter the lateral component of the
 horizontal wind but instead is replaced by possible bias in those coefficients,
 as discussed for element 2.

 Evaluation at typical values shows that the dependence of the measured
 lateral component of the horizontal wind on uncertainty in this variable
 is negligible.

 The temperature error is likely a bias, so this difference also should
 be treated as a bias.
 The result is that the longitudinal component of the horizontal wind has
 an elemental contribution from temperature of 0.16

 to the error in airspeed of about 0.16/240 or smaller than 0.1%) has negligible

 Here the dominant contribution arises from the corrections applied to dynamic
 pressure to address the measured static defect as determined from calibrations.
 Measurements of the longitudinal wind provided by the LAMS have uncertainty
 of only about 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, so when this instrument is available the uncertainty could be reduced;
 the tabulated uncertainty includes an estimate of how well the parameterized
 function used to correct pressure in the absence of LAMS actually represents
 those measurements adequately.
 Some of the uncertainty entering this assessment arises because the LAMS
 and the radome gust-sensing system measure at locations displaced from
 each other and so may encounter slightly different wind conditions.

The primary uncertainty in BDIF_GP is assigned to bias because it is likely
 a calibration uncertainty and the resolution and stability are much smaller
 than this bias.
 However, a calibration bias in this measurement does not affect the final
 wind measurement because the procedure in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 determines the sideslip angle from flight data in a way that can be considered
 a calibration of the measurement of sideslip angle, and a bias in BDIF_GP
 would be reflected in a change in sensitivity coefficients determined in
 that section that would compensate for that bias.
 Only random errors in BDIF_GP propagate to the final measurement of horizontal
 wind, and the effect of the listed random error is typically less than
 0.0001 m/s in lateral wind, with even smaller contribution to the longitudinal
 wind.
 These contributions therefore are listed as negligible in the table.
 The next item considers the more uncertain determination of sensitivity
 coefficient for sideslip angle.

 effectively removes the effects of possible biases in BDIF_GP and QC_GP

\begin_inset Formula $e_{0},\,e_{1}$
\end_inset

} in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) and the ability of the selected formula to represent the calibration data.
 For sideslip angle, the fit procedure used values of heading and ground
 speed components determined from the gust-pod IRU, but wind components
 determined from the radome system.
 This allowed better determination of sensitivity coefficients than would
 have been possible from "bootstrapping" gust-pod measurements using repeated
 iterations, because the wind measurements from the radome system have lower
 uncertainty than those from the gust-pod system.
 However, this means for example that the offset in sideslip angle or heading
 will be dependent on the values from the radome system.
 Adjustment using the circle maneuvers of Sect.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is not possible for the gust pod because the wind measurements are compromised
 at the high bank angles required for the circle maneuver, so other adjustment
 is necessary.
 Values of SS_GP
\begin_inset Index var

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 are at least as uncertain as those from SSRD because the SS_GP calibration

 0.03 and 0.002
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, are lower limits for the uncertainty in calibration coefficients from
 the gust pod.
 However, the standard deviation between sideslip angle measured by the
 radome (SSRD) and that measured by the gust pod (SS_GP) is typically about
 0.3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, an indication that the uncertainty in SS_GP may be much larger.

For comparison, the standard deviation in the difference between AKRD and

\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

\end_layout

\end_inset

 This large standard deviation might arise partly from different turbulent
 components being measured at the radome and at the gust pod, but this seems
 unreasonably high for that explanation because the standard deviation correspon
ds to a standard deviation in the difference in lateral wind at the two
 locations of 1.25

 Instead, it appears that there is some source of error affecting SS_GP
 and that the elemental uncertainty assigned to the random error arising
 from application of the SS_GP calibration must be increased to 0.3

 until this discrepancy between SSRD and SS_GP can be resolved.

 Application of the calibration procedure based on comparison to the laser

m/s for fluctuating conditions, so this is used for the table entry pertaining
 to the wind component in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the
 aircraft.
 For the lateral component, QC_GP affects the calculated sideslip angle
 SS_GP, but the procedure to determine sensitivity coefficients removes
 any effect of bias in QC_GP by calibration in terms of the coefficients
 {
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0},\,c_{1}$

} so a potential bias in QC_GP does not enter the lateral component of the
 horizontal wind but instead is replaced by possible bias in those coefficients,

 there appeared to be problems with the measurement, was 0.3

 The resulting heading variable retains the high-frequency response of the
 gust-pod IRU, needed to address issues like wing flex or vibration of the
 pod, but used the higher-quality measurement of heading from the fuselage
 IRU for long-term updating.
 This can improve the measurement of horizontal wind from the gust pod significa
ntly, at the expense of having the measurements use a reference measurement
 outside the instrument.
 If improvement in the measurement of horizontal wind from the gust pod
 becomes important, such processing can be used for special cases.

 the values used for these estimates are the result of intercomparisons
 between units and are much higher than the best specifications for the
 unit listed in Table

 For the longitudinal component, the corresponding results are 0.3 and 0.2

 Here the dominant contribution arises from the corrections applied to dynamic
 pressure to address the measured static defect as determined from calibrations,

 The combined uncertainty is obtained by adding the estimate of bias and
 the estimate of random error in quadrature, but this characteristic can
 be questioned because the bias estimate does not have normal statistical
 characteristics.
 It is preferable to use the estimates of bias and of the random component

 The uncertainty approaches 2

 in turns and should not be used for roll angles exceeding about 5

 The problem with measurements in turns arises because the gust-pod system
 is not aligned with the longitudinal axis of the aircraft so, in turns,
 the three attitude angles (pitch, roll, heading) become intermixed.
 It may be that the appropriate angle transformations can be found to handle
 this problem, but current processing leads to obvious errors in turns.

Some support for this value of uncertainty in vertical wind from the gust

\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

 While this is slightly lower than the measured difference, some of that
 difference can arise from real differences in vertical wind at the two
 locations on the aircraft and from timing differences, so the measured
 standard error is in reasonable agreement with the expectations from the

gust pod is not recommended.
 That system was designed to provide a back-up measurement that could be
 anti-iced to remain operational in heavy cloud.
 In the case of vertical wind, it appears that the system fills this back-up
 roll well.
 However, the horizontal wind from the gust pod is much inferior to that
 from the radome-based system and probably should be used only with much
 caution.
 That would involve checking that the measurement of heading from the gust-pod
 IRU provides measurements in reasonable agreement with other units, considering
 installation differences in orientation) and excluding turns.
 An additional restriction arises from the fit restrictions used to determine
 the coefficients in the equation representing angle of attack.
 Those restrictions were: true airspeed (TASF) greater than 130
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, absolute value of roll less than 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and altitude greater than 5000
\begin_inset space ~

m.
 Outside these limits, extrapolation errors can lead to significant errors
 in the measurements from the gust pod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The straightforward way to improve the measurements from the gust pod would
 be to improve the measurement of heading.
 It might be possible to calculate a surrogate heading from the fuselage
 IRU and the known installation offset of the gust-pod IRU, but this hasn't
 been investigated yet and would require continued study beyond that reported

\end_layout

\end_inset

The first three lines in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Summary-of-uncertainty"

\end_inset

 claim that wind can be measured with low uncertainty from a high-speed
 aircraft such as the NCAR/NSF GV.
 This is particularly challenging at high speed because the aircraft introduces
 flow distortions and pressure variations over and near the fuselage that
 affect many of the sensors used to measure wind.
 Calibration by comparison to a laser air-motion sensor has led to improvement
 in the measurement of horizontal wind and is the basis for achieving these
 tolerances.
 Calibration maneuvers, especially those involving flying circles, have
 provided evidence for the claimed limits to uncertainty and have refined
 some of the calibrations used to achieve these limits.
 The fourth line in the table indicates disappointing performance for the
 gust-pod measurement of the component of horizontal wind lateral to the
 aircraft, so in general this measurement should not be used for research
 without further improvement.
 However, the measurement` of vertical wind from the gust pod provides a
 useful back-up to the conventional measurement.

\begin_layout Standard
can be used as a reference angle of attack to which to fit a parameterized
 formula.
 This fit reference depends on measurements of pitch, rate-of-climb, and
 true airspeed.
 Even in the presence of waves, fitting functions of the radome measurements
 and other flight characteristics to this reference should average any real
 effects of vertical wind as long as the vertical wind over the flight segments
 used averages to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The danger in this approach is that a particular data set may not have negligibl
e average mean wind.
 For example, if a flight spent more time in the updraft regions in the
 ascending portion upwind of the island and less in the downdraft region
 downwind of the island, the mean measurement of vertical wind may not be
 negligible.
 The functions used for representation of angle of attack always include
 an offset term along with functions of measurements, so it may be appropriate
 to adjust that offset if there is evidence that the mean vertical wind
 should not be zero.
 Other steps can be taken to check that offset coefficient, as discussed
 in subsequent sections.
 One compromise, followed below, is to determine any coefficients other
 than the offset term from comprehensive data sets but then revise the constant
 coefficient in the fit on the basis of special periods expected to average
 to zero vertical wind, like flight over the ocean well away from weather
 disturbances or special calibration flights in conditions with apparently
 level air motions.

In the case of the standard radome-based system on the GV, the relevant
 variables are 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

=PITCH, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}=$
\end_inset

GGVSPD, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V=$
\end_inset

TASF.
 The system measures the pressure difference (ADIFR) between top and bottom
 ports on the radome, and this pressure is then normalized by some measure
 of dynamic pressure like QCF or QCFC.
\begin_inset Index var
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
QCFC=corrected dynamic pressure [hPa]
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The former is preferable because the use of corrected QCFC requires the
 application of static-defect corrections that themselves depend on angle
 of attack, leading to circularity in the calculation.
 Other candidates QCR and QCRC are not chosen because they can be affected
 by icing or freezing of accumulated water in pressure lineseven when ADIFR
 continues to function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the gust pod, the relevant variables are 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

=CPITCH_GP, 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

=CVSPD_GP, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

=TASF.
 The gust-pod measurements differ from those measured relative to the fuselage;
 for example, the pitch of the gust pod is several degrees different from
 that of the fuselage because of the way in which the gust-pod IRU is installed.
 However, the true airspeed 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) is measured better by the fuselage system, so TASF will be used for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 The equation with the appropriate variables is then:

 Possible terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\{m_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 in that function may include ADIFR and related measurements of pressure
 and dynamic pressure as well as Mach number, as well as powers and products
 of these terms.
 For the Rosemount 858 sensor used with the gust pod, it is expected from
 theory that one element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{m_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 will be ADIF_GP/QC_GP.
 Wind tunnel and theoretical studies predict how the pressure will vary
 on a hemispheric surface with changing angles, but those don't necessarily
 apply to the mounting location on the GV because there is considerable
 flow distortion at the under-wing location of the pod and that affects
 the pressure response to changes in flow angles.
 Therefore the above approach is used for that sensor also and determines
 a separate functional representation of the calibration data for the gust
 pod.

 On RF11, there was a similar speed run flown from 10:30--10:40 at an altitude

\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

 For the purpose of this first determination of sensitivity coefficients
 for angle of attack, only those periods were used.
 In addition, because some of the measurements at minimum speed deviated
 from the otherwise simple fits, only measurements with true airspeed in
 excess of 130 m/s were used; this eliminated some of the slowest parts
 of the speed runs, but that is a flight speed not used in normal operation.

The sensitivity to the pressure difference between vertically separated
 ports is the most important part of the calibration of angle of attack.
 Secondary terms are sometimes needed to adjust the value to maintain a
 correct zero.
 Therefore, the fit was done in two stages.
 First, the four speed runs alone were used to determine the sensitivity
 to the pressure ratio, and then a larger dataset was used to incorporate
 a wider range of flight conditions to check that the fit determined from
 the speed runs remained representative of the larger data set..
 The first fit was to the following simplified equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\alpha^{*}=c_{0}^{*}+c_{1}^{*}\frac{\Delta p_{\alpha}}{q}\label{eq:AOAsens1term}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}^{*}$

 are sensitivity coefficients determined by the fit.

, the thin gray line under the thick orange dashed line represents the uncertain
ty in the fit result and shows that the uncertainty in representing these
 data with this set of coefficients is negligible.
 The more significant uncertainty, however, comes from the assumption that
 the vertical wind is zero for these periods of the speed runs.
 Therefore, additional studies will be used below for further evaluation
 of the uncertainty introduced by this assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This calibration would be affected by a time difference between the IRU
 measurement of pitch and the data-system sampling of the pressures involved,
 especially that from the radome.
 The IRU outputs measurements with a time delay that can be variable and
 unknown but is expected to be <0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s, and normal processing uses an adjustment of 60
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

ms to compensate for this delay.
 To guard against this delay affecting the calibration, fits like that leading
 to the above formula and coefficients were repeated after shifting the
 measurement of pitch by various time intervals, both forward and backward.
 For shifts within about 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s, the results did not change significantly, although the fit with adjustment
 of pitch 
\emph on
backward
\emph default
 by about 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s had the smallest standard error .
 Equivalently, a similar standard error was obtained if the measurement
 of the pressure ratio from the radome (
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

) were moved forward in time by a similar amount.
 Neither of these shifts seems likely at this magnitude, and the change
 in standard error was only about 0.002
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so we interpret this as indicating insensitivity of the calibration to
 small shifts in time.
 That is likely a result of the calibration data being from speed runs where
 the flight speed is gradually increased and then decreased, so any effect
 of a lag partially cancels in such data segments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calibration would also be affected by pitch errors such as are discussed
 in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Schuler"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore the correction procedure discussed in that section was applied
 to these data before finding the preceding fit.
 In comparison to the fit without this correction, the standard error was
 changed only negligibly and the two fit coefficients changed by -0.007 and
 -0.004, respectively, so this correction also had only minor effect on the
 fit, with changes comparable to or smaller than the standard errors in
 these coefficients.
 This insensitivity perhaps arises because the period of the calibration
 spanned a few hours and so included enough time for the Schuler oscillation
 of pitch to average over the dataset used for calibration.

Previous studies of the radome where low-altitude flight segments were included

\begin_layout Standard
Because the standard fit in use for the GV includes an additional term represent
ing dependence on Mach number, the benefit of using such a fit for DEEPWAVE
 is worth considering.
 The primary reason for that fit has been that otherwise the measurements
 of vertical wind at low level tend to be biased, but most of the useful
 flight data from DEEPWAVE was at intermediate or high levels so this may
 not be a concern for this project.

Fitting (

\end_inset

) to the speed-run data gave a standard error that is reduced by <0.006
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so for those measurements this small improvement does not seem to justify
 adding another term to the fit.
 This will be revisited later in this section with an expanded data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next step was to expand the data set to include flights from a range
 of altitudes including up to FL450, and to see if it is necessary to refine
 the fit to include additional terms like that in Eq.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 to constrain the zero of the angle of attack while preserving the measured
 sensitivity as in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 This expanded dataset included RF14, with a FL450 leg from 11:30 to 12:20
 UTC; RF16, with a FL430 leg from 9:30 to 11:00 UTC; RF03, all measurements

ft flight altitude (to incorporate a long flight where fuel burn-off changed
 the angle of attack); and an expanded section from RF11 (in addition to
 the speed runs) from 7:00 to 10:00 UTC, to include a long leg at FL400.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Various fit equations were explored involving terms including the Mach number,
 the air density, the measured pressures, and various products and powers
 of these terms including terms multiplied by the basic pressure ratio already
 included in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AOAsens1term"

\end_inset

).
 None of these produced enough improvement over the single-term fit to warrant
 their inclusion; the best improvement in the residual standard error was
 about 2%.

Additional terms that did improve the fit significantly were those correlated

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, esp.
\begin_inset space ~

pitch, but including such terms is not consistent with finding a fit that
 would represent the angle of attack in conditions with non-zero vertical
 wind.
 For example, including "PITCH" as a term in the fit resulted in a coefficient
 for this term of about 0.4, and such a large correlation between resulting
 measurements of angle of attack and pitch would bias the response to a
 true vertical wind.
 As an extreme example, inclusion of a term based on the right side of Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 leads to a perfect fit, but use of such a fit would ensure that all measurement
s of vertical wind would be zero.
 For this reason, pitch and vertical aircraft motion were excluded from
 the candidate terms in the fit.

\end_inset

 for 17,715 measurements.
 The small increase in standard error in comparison to the speed-run measurement
s is expected because this expanded data set includes regions more likely
 to have non-zero vertical wind, which contributes to this error.
 Expanding this fit to include a third coefficient as in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:AOAstandard"

\end_inset

) resulted in negligible improvement (0.001
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

) in the standard error, and introduction of a set of eight possible dependencie
s while exploring for better fits only led to reduction in the the standard
 error by 0.003
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so more complicated equations than (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

This simpler representation applies to the normal research flight levels
 of the DEEPWAVE project, levels above about 10,000 ft.
 Because expanded representations were needed in other projects to represent
 low-level flight data, and low levels are not included in this expended
 data set, it may be necessary to revisit this calibration with more terms
 if lower-level flight segments are to be analyzed.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Another fit considered with this expanded data set was to set the slope
 parameter to the value obtained from the speed-run data, 20.986, and then
 fit using the expanded data set to determine a value of the offset coefficient
 that minimized the mean vertical wind.
 That gave a value for the first coefficient of 4.43 and a standard error
 negligibly different from that for the two-coefficient fit, so that is
 another indication that the speed-run dataset and the expanded dataset
 give consistent results.

Evaluation of all the points in the expanded DEEPWAVE dataset using three

 The angle of attack evaluated from the expanded-dataset coefficients resulted
 in values 0.036

\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 so the correlated uncertainties partially cancel, leaving a net uncertainty
 in angle of attack of 0.0007

 in the fit.

\begin_layout Standard
The expanded dataset provided results consistent with those from the speed
 runs alone but contained 17,721 measurements vs.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

only 2,019 for the speed-run dataset, so this larger set provides an opportunity
 to examine the consistency of results from subsets of the measurements.
 For this purpose, randomly selected but exclusive subsets of the data were
 selected repeatedly and the fit coefficients were determined from each
 of these subsets.
 In one example, the dataset was divided randomly into 100 exclusive subsets
 and the fit coefficients were calculated for each of those subsets, and
 then this process was repeated 50 times.
 The resulting standard deviations in the fit coefficients were 0.070 and
 0.88.
 With resampling, the independent samples entering these averages are fewer
 than 5000 but more than 100, suggesting that the means for the coefficients
 are known with uncertainties of between 0.007 -- 0.001 for the first coefficient
 and 0.09--0.012 for the second.
 The estimates from the fit (0.004, 0.053) are midway in these ranges, so
 the fit results are consistent when the data are partitioned into various
 subsets.
 The fit results thus appear reasonably characterized by the estimated standard
 errors from the fit.

Repeating this for different subset sizes 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

 indicated that the standard deviations in the coefficients scaled in a
 manner consistent with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{N}$
\end_inset

 behavior, suggesting that the results are not biased by isolated outlier
 measurements such as would occur from regions of extended non-zero vertical
 wind.
 The subsetting also produced resulting values for the individual coefficients
 that were highly correlated, with correlation coefficient around 0.99.
 This also supports the partial cancellation of uncertainty as evaluated
 for the fits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These estimates of uncertainty characterize how well the sensitivity coefficient
s characterize the data, but the validity of the result is dependent on
 the mean vertical wind being zero, as discussed in connection with Eq.

 A non-zero mean vertical wind of 0.1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s will introduce bias into the first sensitivity coefficient of magnitude
 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, a value much larger than the estimated uncertainty in angle of attack
 resulting from the fit.
 This then is the major uncertainty affecting angle of attack and hence
 vertical wind, and it is difficult to quantify except by estimates of how
 large the vertical wind might be.
 For all 1-s measurements of vertical wind in the DEEPWAVE project, the
 mean vertical wind was 0.03
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s without correction for pitch errors and <0.01
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s with such correction, in both cases with a standard deviation of about
 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 When measurements are partitioned into groups within 1-5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 longitude upwind and downwind of the island crest, using a slanted dividing
 line approximately matching the orientation of the island, the two groups
 had respective mean vertical wind measurements of -0.026 and +0.032
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s, so even over the South Island of New Zealand there was no significant
 mean vertical wind at the altitude of research flights.
 It therefore seems reasonable to use a limit of about 0.05
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s as applicable to the calibration process, and so a bias limit on the
 first sensitivity coefficient of magnitude 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 This is then the dominant uncertainty component entering the measurement
 of angle of attack.

 flights that appeared to provide good data for the calibration procedure

 The excluded flights were 6 and 7 (where there were problems with ice-blocked
 lines in the radome), and 15 (the calibration flight, mostly at lower than
 research flight altitude).
 Also, the period from 9:50 to 10:30 UTC on flight 23 was excluded because
 the radome measurements looked suspicious and might have been affected
 by blockage.
 Pitch corrections as discussed in the preceding section were applied to
 these flights, and then the following tests were used to exclude periods
 not significant for the calibration: a) measurements where the true airspeed
 was less than 130 m/s, to exclude periods of anomalously high angle of
 attack, esp.
 during takeoff and landing when flaps and/or landing gear might be deployed;
 (b) periods when the roll angle was less than -5 or more than +5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 to emphasize the altitudes most used during research flights.
 More than 400,000 measurements were available for the fit after these exclusion

 These coefficients are similar to those determined for the subset data
 used previously, but they could be used instead if the goal is to minimize
 the offsets in mean vertical wind for the project because, for the constraints
 used, they will force a project-mean vertical wind of 0.
 A test of these coefficients for the segment of flight 12 away from the
 influence of South Island indeed led to a mean wind very close to zero,
 and flight-by-flight averages also are reasonably small with these coefficients.

As for the radome, an all-project fit was obtained for the gust pod.
 In this case, different flights were excluded: 2, 3, 4, 11, 15, 17, 18,
 19, 23, 24, 25 and the flight period from 8:05--8:40UTC on flight 1.
 In most cases, this was because the CMIGITS IRU providing gust-pod measurements
 of pitch seemed to have larger than normal deviations that appeared suspicious,

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Equations underlying the calibration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Calibration of the sideslip angle is more difficult, both because the equations
 are more complicated and because the maneuver is very hard to fly.
 Ideally, the yaw maneuver should only change sideslip angle and heading
 without change in roll, altitude, or angle of attack, but that is impossible
 to fly.
 It is practical, however, to minimize roll and change in altitude, and
 that was how these maneuvers were flown.
 The three sets of yaw maneuvers on DEEPWAVE

\end_inset

 flight 15 were at these times: 3:32:00--3:35:30, 4:31:00--4:33:30, and
 5:26:40--5:29:30 UTC.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Because the yaw maneuvers on rf11 (10:25:00 to 10:30:00) were flown less
 well, they were not combined with these new measurements, but it does not
 appear that the sideslip calibration has any significant dependence on
 altitude.
\end_layout

\end_inset

In the case of yaw maneuvers,
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
maneuver!yaw
\end_layout

\end_inset

 the calibration is based on the expectation that the horizontal wind remains
 constant.
 The first-order equations for the east and north components of the wind,
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
u & = & -U_{a}\sin(\Psi+\beta)+u_{p}\nonumber \\
v & = & -U_{a}\cos(\Psi+\beta)+v_{p}\label{eq:horizWindeqs}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{a}$
\end_inset

 is the true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 the heading, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 the sideslip angle, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{p}$
\end_inset

 are the eastward and northward ground-speed components of the aircraft.
 These two equations lead to the following reference formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta^{*}=-\Psi+\arctan\left(\frac{u_{p}-u}{v_{p}-v}\right)\label{eq:beta-equation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the second term represents a correction for the change in direction
 of motion of the aircraft, which is difficult to avoid in the yaw maneuver.
 The measurements thus provide 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$
\end_inset

, an estimate of the sideslip angle during the yaw maneuvers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is, however, a circular component in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta-equation"

\end_inset

) because it involves the wind components and those require 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for their measurement when sideslip angle changes.
 To reduce the feedback from this term, the horizontal wind components 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 were low-pass-filtered with periods ranging from 5--60 s and the filtered
 values were used in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:beta-equation"

\end_inset

).
 Filtering made small differences in the fit coefficients but increased
 the residual error significantly, but 60-s filtering was still selected
 because that is a period long in comparison to the yaw maneuvers so it
 should reduce possible bias in the fit coefficients from use of the older
 sensitivity coefficients and any associated fluctuations in the wind measuremen
ts during maneuvers.

 angle via

 the horizontal wind, which would contribute this magnitude error for wind

 The respective uncertainties in the fit coefficients were about 0.005 and
 0.17

 of 0.17/22.3 or less than 1% in the value of the sideslip angle.
 Measurements of sideslip angle are seldom larger than 0.2

subsection*{The Components of the Relative Wind}% % The gust pod is a new
 wind-sensing system so it is useful to document how the measurements are
 handled.
 The probe itself has five pressure-sensing holes located on a hemispheric
 cap pointed into the wind.
 The pressure difference between the two ports located upward and downward
 from centerline, measured as ADIF
\backslash
_GP, is used in the calculation of angle of attack.
 The similar pressure difference between the two ports located toward starboard
 and toward port of centerline, measured as BDIF
\backslash
_GP, are used in the calculation of sideslip.
 In addition, the probe has static ports located on the side of the cylinder
 carrying the hemispheric cap, and the difference between the pressure at
 the forward port and that at the static ports is measured as the dynamic
 pressure QC
\backslash
_GP.
 The static pressure is also measured, as PS
\backslash
_GP.% % In addition, there is an inertial reference unit mounted with the
 gust pod to measure its attitude angles (roll, pitch, heading) and to measure
 the three components of motion of the aircraft relative to the Earth.
 This unit receives GPS information and uses it to update its measurements
 via a Kalman filter.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurements ADIF_GP and BDIF_GP, normalized by QC_GP, are used with
 the calibrations in the preceding section to find the angle of attack and
 sideslip angle.
 In addition, to find the relative wind, 
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
airspeed!gust pod
\end_layout

\end_inset

a measurement of true airspeed is needed.
 In an effort to allow the gust-pod system to operate independently of the
 standard radome-based system, it is desirable to determine the true airspeed
 directly from the gust-pod measurements.
 However, the standard system has been calibrated to low uncertainty by
 reference to the laser air-motion sensor, so for the purpose of calibration
 that true airspeed (TASF) will be used as a reference.
 Once the gust-pod measurement of true airspeed is calibrated, the gust-pod
 system still measures wind without further reference to the standard system,
 but the calibration process links the two systems to have a common reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, the next step needed to use the gust pod wind-sensing system
 is to determine a functional relationship between gust-pod measurements
 and the true airspeed.
 The approach taken is to fit the basic pressure ratio 
\begin_inset Formula $q/p$
\end_inset

 as measured by the 858 probe to match the corresponding pressure ratio
 provided by the conventional measurements of dynamic and static pressure.
 The relationship represents the true ratio of dynamic to static pressure,
 so using that ratio the normal calculation of true airspeed can be used
 to determine the airspeed measured by the gust pod.
 For this purpose, all the measurements from the calibration flight (RF15)
 were used qualified only by requiring TASF>130 m/s, absolute value of roll
 smaller than 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, and altitude above 5000
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m.
 These restrictions were selected because the DEEPWAVE
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 project mostly needed such measurements and low uncertainty could only
 be obtained with some restrictions on the measurements.
 This is the first use of the gust-pod measurements, so for future projects
 and different research objectives this approach should be repeated with
 different restrictions.

.
 The fit provides a reasonable representation of TASF, with a standard error
 of about 0.4
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 This is not much larger than the estimated uncertainty in TASF (about 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s), so wind calculations might be based on this value if necessary.
 However, there is serious danger of over-fitting with this many coefficients
 and variables, even though the fit was improved significantly with each
 addition; indeed, the standard error in the 
\begin_inset Formula $q/p$
\end_inset

 fit was reduced by 50% with the addition of the last two variables in the
 fit.
 Because of the danger that this variable might not perform as well when
 used outside the range of this fit (which was TASF > 130, |ROLL| < 5, and
 GGALT > 5000),
\begin_inset Index var
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
GGALT=geometric altitude above the Earth from GPS [m]
\end_layout

\end_inset

 it still should be better to base wind measurements from the gust pod on
 the conventional TASF combined with the relative-wind angles from the gust
 pod.
 However, if it is desirable to have a wind measurement that is completely
 independent of the standard radome-based system, using true airspeed measured
 with this fit might provide a useful alternative.

.
 The standard vertical wind calculation depends on a measurement of vertical
 motion of the aircraft.
 Past projects have used one of VSPD (from the IRU), VSPD_A, VSPD_G or GGVSPD
 (from GPS, the first two alternate names for the value provided by the
 avionics package) or, much earlier, WP3 from a baro-inertial update loop
 using VSPD.
 Baro-inertial updating is no longer used because the Honeywell IRU that
 now provides VSPD already incorporates such updating.
 For the systems based on the gust pod or LAMS, additional vertical-velocity
 measurements are provided by their pod-mounted IRUs, respectively CVSPD_GP
 and CVSPD_LAMS.
 Changing roll of the aircraft can cause these measurements to differ from
 the fuselage-based measurements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because VSPD as provided by the Honeywell IRU is controlled against the
 known instability of IRU measurements in the vertical by updating to a
 reference value provided by pressure altitude,
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
baro-inertial updating
\end_layout

\end_inset

 it has some drawbacks.
 Pressure altitude is not really a measure of altitude but of pressure,
 so the reference altitude can be biased.
 Also, the IRU-imposed baro-inertial loop has unknown response characteristics
 and uncertainty, and the value provided by the IRU
\begin_inset Index idx

 The advantage of an IRU variable over a GPS

), where the difference between IRU and GPS measurements is low-pass filtered
 and the result is added to the IRU measurement.
 This preserves the high-frequency response of the IRU measurement but causes
 the low-frequency components to match the GPS measurements, thus providing
 both absolute accuracy and valid high-frequency measurements.
 It seems worthwhile to explore a similar approach for the vertical wind,
 to see if there is an advantage to a variable that is provided by an analogous
 complementary filter.

In addition, the Honeywell

 IRU provides a measurement of vertical acceleration.
 In a special calculation, this was integrated to get velocity and the result
 compared to VSPD.
 The results of the integration and the variance spectrum of that result
 were quite similar to VSPD, provided that a feedback loop was used to avoid
 exponentially growing errors from positive feedback, so there is no advantage
 to using that integrated acceleration in place of VSPD.
 (It was hoped that some of the filtering imposed on VSPD could be avoided.)

 wind of 1.0

 Much of the variation in vertical wind was from waves, so the field was
 not fully developed turbulence, but the signals to be resolved had enough
 intensity that noise floors on the measurements were not a problem.

The two measures of vertical aircraft motion, GGVSPD

 (from the GPS receiver) and VSPD
\begin_inset Index var

\begin_layout Plain Layout
VSPD
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (from the inertial reference unit), have important differences in their
 properties.
 At high frequency, VSPD (orange line) decreases rapidly with increasing
 frequency, so it makes negligible contribution to the vertical wind (WI)
 at frequencies above 1 Hz.
 In contrast, GGVSPD (red line) does not show a similar steep drop in variance
 until after about 2 Hz, and it continues to make an important contribution
 to WIC over the frequency range from about 0.3 to 3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz.
 The absence of spectral variance above about 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz in VSPD appears to be the result of internal filtering of this signal
 in the inertial unit, and indeed some limited information on the properties
 of the signals does indicate filtering at about this frequency.
 Because the aircraft motion clearly has components in this frequency range
 (based on the feel of the ride in turbulence), it appears that WI
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 should not be used for frequencies above about 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inertial-system variable VSPD is also subject to pressure damping, and
 this may account for the difference between GGVSPD and VSPD at long wavelength.
 The aircraft normally flies with reference to the pressure altitude, so
 in a region of varying altitude at a given pressure there are fluctuations
 in the aircraft geometric altitude (red line) not reflected in the pressure
 altitude (orange line).
 Both contribute in ways that result in essentially the same spectral variance
 for frequencies below 0.3 Hz, as shown by the near coincidence of the blue
 and cyan lines, so the difference is not significant.
 Here also, though, the red line representing the GPS measurement is a better
 measure of how the vertical wind should be affected, because the pressure-dampe
d orange line will not show real vertical motion of the aircraft as it remains
 on a pressure surface.

 is the preferable variable to use for vertical wind.
 This also answers the question posed earlier regarding the possibility
 of using a combination of measurements from inertial and GPS systems to
 obtain better frequency response.
 The IRU measurements turn out to have poorer frequency response and lead
 to apparent biases for frequencies around 1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz, so this is not a useful combination.
 Instead, it appears best to use the GPS-provided measurement of vertical
 aircraft speed directly without further modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is still some reason for concern about the spectral response of GGVSPD
 at frequencies around 0.5--1

 The sum of GUSTW
\begin_inset Index var

 and GGVSPD determines WIC, and the alternate measure of vertical wind WI
 is the sum of GUSTW and VSPD from the inertial reference unit.
 GUSTW has higher spectral variance than WIC for frequencies below 0.3
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz, so at these frequencies the aircraft motion tends to counter the relative
 wind and reduced the measured variance.
 This would be the case, for example, if there were negligible vertical
 wind and the relative wind arose entirely from the vertical motion of the
 aircraft.
 On the other hand, for frequencies around about 0.5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz the spectral variance in the vertical wind exceeds that in the relative
 wind so the aircraft responds approximately in phase with the vertical
 gusts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The high-frequency variance spectrum has a slope differing a small amount
 from the expected -5/3 spectrum, and that is cause for some concern, but
 the turbulence in this region was not very well developed or consistent
 so this is probably not cause for alarm.
 Very good agreement with expectations has been seen in cases of boundary-layer
 measurements where well-developed turbulence at small scales is expected,
 but in those cases the intensity of turbulence at small scales was greater
 also.
 This is reason to continue to be suspicious of the response around 0.5--1

 Providing this variable could lead to the mistaken expectation that this
 is the uncorrected version of WIC, while the two variables actually use
 different and independent measurements of the vertical motion of the aircraft.
 The argument for using a variable based on VSPD has been that this formerly
 represented the high-frequency contribution better than a GPS variable.
 That is not the case any longer, because GPS measurements have improved
 greatly and the presently available IRU-provided measurements are obviously
 filtered at high frequency.

 Thus the white-noise spectrum is consistent with a random error of about
 the specified uncertainty for the sensor, but this is not the result of
 digital truncation.

The different measurements entering the calculation of vertical wind should
 be sampled at the same time.
 That is particularly difficult in the case of samples from the inertial

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to try to determine appropriate lags from the data and from
 appropriate maneuvers.
 For example, in pitch maneuvers (in which the pitch is alternately increased
 and decreased with typically a 10-s period) if the timing of measurements
 of pitch and angle of attack are not matched or if the measurement of vertical
 speed of the aircraft is not timed correctly there will be a residual measured
 vertical wind, so these maneuvers are particularly stringent tests of the
 relative timing of the signals.

\end_inset

 is angle of attack, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$

 is pitch and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the vertical velocity of the aircraft.
 This equation can be used to adjust relative timing among the signals to
 minimize the variance in vertical wind during the pitch maneuvers.
 A good example is that from DEEPWAVE
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout
DEEPWAVE!flight 15
\end_layout

\end_inset

 flight 15, 3:15--3:18 UTC.
 As initially processed using standard processing at the time of DEEPWAVE,
 the standard deviation in vertical wind through the pitch maneuvers was
 0.4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s while the variance in vertical motion of the aircraft was 5.6
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s.
 A long-standing criterion for acceptable pitch maneuvers is for less than
 10% of the imposed velocity to enter the vertical wind, so by this criterion
 the test was successful.
 However, a plot of the vertical wind shows a clear match to the imposed
 velocity, so it is worthwhile to see if better results are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speed runs have been used to determine the sensitivity coefficients for
 determining

 The sensors producing 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 are located close together and are processed in the standard manner by
 the data acquisition system, so these can be assumed to determine the reference
 time except for possible delays introduced by pressure lines.
 However, the other variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 are determined by independent systems and may have timing offsets from
 the standard measurements, so these are the variables whose lags are explored
 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach was to shift the measurements forward or backward in time and,
 using Eq.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, recalculate the vertical wind.
 The best result obtained in this way was to shift PITCH forward 0.04
\begin_inset space ~

s and shift GGVSPD backward 0.04
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s.
 Almost as good was to shift PITCH forward 0.08
\begin_inset space ~

s and shift GGVSPDB backward 0.04
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s.
 This reset the assumed lag in PITCH to zero while imposing a small lag
 of -0.04
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s in GGVSPD.
 For the purpose of this study, to avoid the phase lag produced by filters
 at the high-frequency limit, Savitzky-Golay filtering was used for GGVSPD
 with 4th-order polynomials applied over 25-measurement intervals to smooth
 the original measurements.
 The resulting standard deviation in WIX was 0.22
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s, vs 0.23 with no shift in GGVSPD, so it may be preferable to leave the
 assumed lag for GGVSPD at zero to avoid the awkwardness of advancing the
 measurement in time.

There is little signal corresponding to the imposed vertical motion or variation
s in pitch, and the measured standard deviation in vertical wind is about
 the same as that for measurements just before and just after the pitch
 maneuvers.
 It thus appears that the measuring system is able to remove the effects
 of the pitch maneuvers with essentially undetectable residual.
 The suggested conclusion is that the assumed delay in pitch should be reset
 to zero.

 which is provided by inertial reference units and therefore has the uncertainty
 and fluctuations associated with those systems.
 An inertial system aligns during initialization to detect the local vertical
 direction and then calculates the new vertical direction as the aircraft
 moves (changing the local vertical direction) and accelerates (which can
 cause gyros to precess).
 Any misalignment present at initialization persists but also can oscillate
 and can cause errors in roll and pitch to mix as the aircraft changes flight
 direction.
 The standard uncertainty associated with this measurement is 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 for flight duration of a few hours, and the error often increases during
 the flight as heading errors and accelerometer biases affect the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work of Schuler (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Schuler1923"

\end_inset

) demonstrated that coupling among some of these error sources leads to
 limits on the growth of errors and to simultaneous oscillations in some
 of the measurement errors.
 In particular, an error in pitch leads to an error in horizontal acceleration,
 and integration of that error in horizontal acceleration leads to a position
 error that grows so as to compensate for the original error in pitch.
 However, when the error in pitch is reduced to zero, errors in position
 and velocity have been accumulated and those lead to growth of the error
 in pitch in the direction opposite to the original error.
 The result is a Schuler oscillation having a period of

min, where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{e}$
\end_inset

 is the radius of the Earth and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 the acceleration of gravity.
 The existence of this coupling allows estimation of the pitch error if
 the error in horizontal acceleration is known.
 That is the case in DEEPWAVE because high-quality measurements of velocity
 are available from GPS and those measurements can be compared to the uncorrecte
d measurements from the inertial systems to measure the error in velocity
 and, from its derivative, the error in acceleration.
 The specified uncertainty for the IRU, 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, contributes an uncertainty in measured vertical wind of about 0.2 m/s,
 and Table

 lists this as the dominant contribution to uncertainty in that measurement.
 Therefore, improving the measurement of pitch can lead to important reduction
 in the uncertainty associated with measurement of vertical wind.

The result is that this erroneous acceleration produces a false northward
 velocity and, integrated, a northward error in position.
 However, the error then causes the integrated position to become too far
 north, where the calculated direction toward the center of the earth becomes
 biased in the opposite direction, and at some point the calculated offset
 from being too far north equals the pitch bias, as shown in the next figure:

 the integrated velocity is zero but the new error in pitch now causes a

 Because this matrix imposes rotations by the measured pitch and roll angles,
 the unit vector representing the errors in pitch and roll after transformation
 will have components from which the true pitch and roll can be determined,
 so subtracting the corrected pitch from the measured pitch gives the error
 in measured pitch:

 a corrected value of the pitch for use in the calculation of vertical wind.

 introduction of new errors from heading errors.
 The corrections to pitch therefore appear much less systematic than was
 the case for the ferry flight.

 There are instances where the pitch error abruptly reverses sign; those

 During turns, the full transformation leads to a result significantly different

 In straight-and-level flight, the needed corrections are about

 Correction for this error thus should lead to a significant reduction in

 corrections made any significant difference in the measurements of vertical
 wind.
 First, wind measurements made before and after level course reversal were
 compared to see if correcting

 the pitch reduces the difference in measurements on the two legs before
 and after turns.
 Reduction would be expected because if there is a pitch error it would
 reverse sign between the two legs, increasing their absolute difference.
 Second, flight-average and project-average vertical wind measurements were
 compiled without and with the pitch correction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is a tabulation of five instances where the flight track reversed
 course and remained at the same altitude.
 A number of other candidates were excluded because conditions were too
 variable along the legs to produce a small-uncertainty estimate of the
 vertical wind.
 In each case, flight periods of about 5 min (sometimes adjusted in times
 of strong wind to give similar-length segments flown upwind and downwind)
 are listed before and after the turn, but excluding the turn, to represent
 approximately overlapping flight segments where it would be expected that
 the vertical wind would be the same.

\begin_layout Standard
The difference between average vertical wind measurements for each pair
 of legs was calculated before and after applying the pitch-correction algorithm
 developed in this subsection.
 The measurements were in good agreement without any pitch correction, with
 an average absolute value of the difference between opposing legs of 0.09
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$

.
 The pitch correction kept the averages quite small and improved the agreement,
 reducing the mean value of the difference to 0.03
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 More significant that this reduction is that the values were so small even
 before correction.
 This is a good indicator of the low uncertainty of the pitch measurement
 even without correction.
 A course-reversal difference of 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

s
\begin_inset Formula $^{-1}$
\end_inset

 would result from a pitch error of less than 0.015
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so this suggests that the inertial system is performing significantly
 better than its specified uncertainty (0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

).
 After correction, the mean difference suggests an error of less than 0.005
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 for the corrected values.

 Any missing measurements were also excluded from the averages, and measurements
 from flights 6, 7, and 15 are not included because the first two were cases
 where the conventional vertical-wind measuring system malfunctioned and
 flight 15 was a flight devoted to calibration with little upper-level flight
 and frequent turns including circles.

 The pitch correction has little effect on these mean measurements or the

 not indicate that the measurements are only uncertain within these limits,

 of about 84 min.
 Flights will average over an oscillating correction and that average may
 be small compared to the correction applied.

Constraints arising from the assumption that the wind is steady
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The circle maneuver is a stringent test of the wind measurements because,
 in steady conditions, the measured wind should remain constant around the
 circles.
 From the patterns of deviations with orientation in the turn, it is possible
 to detect an error in true airspeed or an offset in heading or sideslip
 angle.
 A time offset in measured

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ground speed!time offset
\end_layout

\end_inset

ground speed from the GPS relative to the IRU can be detected from an apparent
 change in required heading offset that changes sign with the direction
 of the turn.
 In addition, for circles flown with steady bank angle, the drift of the
 ground track as detected by GPS measures the wind without any reference
 to the measuring system on the aircraft, so this provides a standard against
 which the wind measurements can be checked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For these patterns, the wind should be relatively steady and non-turbulent
 and the roll angle should be constant.
 For this flight segment, the left-turn circles had a roll angle of

0.12, while the mean true airspeed for these circles was 153.5
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$

ons created by the flight management system, as discussed in Sect.

 the roll angle, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 the angle of attack.
 In the circle maneuver, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\approx27^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 so the last two terms in the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 do not simplify with the small-angle approximation.
 If the corresponding components of the horizontal wind are

\end_inset

 is the angle between the relative wind (in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 which is the heading adjusted for the roll angle by components from the
 sideslip angle and angle of attack) and the direction of the wind relative
 to the Earth (
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This equation is justified as follows.
 Because the relative wind transformed to an Earth reference frame is added
 to the ground-speed vector to find the wind, an error 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta V$
\end_inset

 in true airspeed leads to an error of the same magnitude in the component
 of measured wind along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft.
 The measured wind therefore changes by 
\begin_inset Formula $-2\delta V$
\end_inset

 when the aircraft changes from an upwind to a downwind flight direction,
 with the negative sign arising from the convention that wind direction
 is specified as the direction from which the wind blows.
 The error in true airspeed thus can be determined from the difference between
 wind measured while flying upwind and that measured while flying downwind.
 For other flight directions, this error projects to the wind direction
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $-\delta V\cos(\psi^{\prime})$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, when flying crosswind the wind measurement is determined by
 the sum of the ground-speed component along the wind direction and the
 component of the relative wind lateral to the aircraft.
 If the wind is from the port side of the aircraft (e.g., for an east flight
 direction with wind from the north), a positive heading error leads to
 a relative wind component opposing the wind and so to a measurement error
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $-V\delta\psi^{\prime}$
\end_inset

.
 For wind from the starboard side of the aircraft, the sign reverses, and
 for other angles the error contribution is 
\begin_inset Formula $-V\delta\psi^{\prime}\sin(\psi^{\prime})$
\end_inset

.

 These fits should give consistent results, but a fit to

\begin_layout Standard
There is an apparently significant difference of about 1
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

m/s in mean wind speed, both measured and resulting from the fits, between
 the right-turn circles and the left-turn circles.
 This is apparently a real difference between wind conditions in the regions
 where the circles were flown and is supported by the difference between
 maximum and minimum ground speed for the two sets of circles.
 Conditions are more uniform for the right-turn circles, as reflected in
 the lower residual error for those circles, so more weight will be given
 here to the results from the right-turn circles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fits point to a very small heading error that is consistent for the
 two turn directions.
 That result is very sensitive to the timing of signal acquisition; any
 difference in timing between the ground-speed components from the GPS and
 the heading measurement from the IRU will produce an indicated error in
 heading that changes sign with turn direction.
 Shifting either pitch or ground-speed components by 40
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

ms changes the indicated errors in heading by 0.07
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, so these lags are very sensitive to the assumed delay.
 The results here were obtained for a heading shift of 
\begin_inset Formula $-50$

ms, slightly different from the conventional shift of 
\begin_inset Formula $-80$

Some of the fits, notably the left-turn circles from the third maneuver,
 don't conform very well to the expected sinusoidal error pattern.
 The residual error about the fit was the largest of the circles, with the
 right-turn circles having almost as large a residual error, which may indicate
 that conditions were not sufficiently uniform to use these maneuvers.
 However, if all six are averaged, the mean values for the indicated error
 in airspeed is 0.25

 Because the wind is more nearly uniform and the pattern of measurements

 because Fig.

ref{fig:gs-only-plot} shows better consistency for the two right-turn circles
 vs the left-turn circles, here the right-turn circles will be emphasized.
 They indicate that the wind measurements (with time-shifting as discussed
 above) are quite good, with indicated errors of only 0.2

 For the right-turn circles, the significant departures are for parts of
 the circles nearly into the wind direction, where the circles start and
 end, so it may be that those small deviations arise from imperfect flight
 patterns for those times.
 Without those parts of the curve, the indicated sinusoidal variation in

In the preceding, the error 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\psi^{\prime}$

 the sideslip angle so the error could also be one in sideslip angle.
 These errors are difficult to separate, and normal sideslip calibration

 even with reverse-heading maneuvers does not provide a separation.
 Furthermore, heading errors may change during a flight because error terms
 undergo a Schuler oscillation and are also affected by horizontal accelerations
 such as occur persistently in turns like those in the circle maneuver.

 so that contribution to

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Because the dependence in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) is on the cosine of the roll which is an even function, left and right
 turns are affected in the same way and also cannot distinguish the two
 terms in the equation.
 Even though three different altitudes were used for these circle maneuvers,
 the GV flight management system maintains nearly the same roll angle for
 all three maneuvers so changes in roll also cannot be used to distinguish
 the contributions from heading offset and sideslip offset.

 In the turns, some sideslip is introduced as the aircraft configuration
 remains slightly nose-up during the turn, and that sideslip angle should
 reverse sign by symmetry when the flight pattern changes from left-turn
 to right-turn circles.
 The lift required to maintain altitude would be the same if the roll angles
 were opposite, as they nearly are for these maneuvers (0.45
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 larger for right turns), and the angle of attack is also close to the same,
 so the expected sign reversal in sideslip angle can be used to estimate
 the offset in sideslip.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

), with some small-angle simplifications, lead to this equation for the
 vertical wind:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
u_{z}=w_{p}+V(\sin\phi\tan\beta+\cos\phi\tan\alpha-\sin\theta\label{eq:vwind-eq-for-SS}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

 is the vertical motion of the aircraft, 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 its true airspeed, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 the roll angle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 the sideslip angle, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 the angle of attack, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 the pitch angle.
 If it is assumed that the vertical wind is zero, in the circle maneuver
 this equation predicts that the sideslip angle will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$
\end_inset

 given by
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\beta^{*}\approx\frac{\theta-\alpha\cos\phi-(w_{p}/V)}{\sin\phi}\,\,\,.\label{eq:beta-from-other-measurements}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This is not useful in straight flight where the roll is near zero, but it
 provides a valid equation for sideslip angle in the case of steady turns.
 The key assumption is that the vertical wind is zero; a vertical wind of
 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s will typically increase the deduced sideslip angle from this equation
 by about 0.06
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$

 mean updraft.
 It is then possible to determine the offset in sideslip angle by comparing
 this prediction to the measured sideslip angle

Wind measurements combine a measurement of relative wind with a measurement
 of aircraft motion to determine the air motion relative to the ground.
 The aircraft motion has long been measured by an IRS, and recently also
 by a GPS.
 These have complementary strengths: The IRS provides very good information
 on short-term motion but drifts with a characteristic period of more than
 an hour, while the GPS provides good absolute accuracy but sometimes is
 unable to receive the GPS signals and (except in differential-GPS mode)
 can have short-term errors that make short segments of the track look jagged.
 To take advantage of the strengths of each, a complementary-filter calculation
 was developed and implemented in the 1980s, but it was never documented
 publicly.
 This section is partly an attempt to remedy that and partly a suggestion
 to make some minor changes to how it is implemented.
 This discussion is complementary to the information in ProcessingAlgorithms.pdf,
 section 3.4, and contains additional detail as well as notes regarding implement
ation of changes.

 of the filter.
 Then the complementary high-pass filter, denoted (
\begin_inset Formula $1-F_{L}$
\end_inset

)(
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathrm{VNS,VEW\}}$
\end_inset

), is applied to the IRS measurements of ground speed, {VNS,VEW}, which
 are assumed valid for frequencies at or higher than 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Ideally, the transition frequency would be selected where the GPS errors
 (increasing with frequency) are equal to the IRS errors (decreasing with
 frequency).
 The filter used hirtorically was a three-pole Butterworth low-pass filter,
 coded following the algorithm described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bozic1980"

\end_inset

, p.
 49.
 This has now been changed to use the Butterworth filter coefficients given
 by the R routine 'butter' for the corresponding filter function.
 The digital filter used is recursive, not centered, to permit calculation
 during a single pass through the data.
 If the cutoff frequency lies where both the GPS and INS measurements are
 valid and are almost the same, then the detailed characteristics of the
 filter in the transition region (e.g., phase shift) do not matter because
 the complementary filters have cancelling effects when applied to the same
 signal.
 The transition frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{c}$
\end_inset

 was chosen to be (1/600) Hz (but this value can be overridden via the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

defaults
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file).
 The Butterworth filter was chosen because it provides flat response away
 from the transition.

This is straightforward and effective when both sets of measurements (IRS
 and GPS) are available.
 The approach in use becomes more complicated when the GPS signals are lost,
 as sometimes happens in sharp turns.
 Then some means is needed to avoid sudden discontinuities in velocity (and
 hence wind speed), which would introduce spurious effects into variance
 spectra and other properties dependent on a continuously valid measurement
 of wind.
 To extrapolate measurements through periods when the GPS measurements are
 not available, a fit is determined to the difference between the best-estimate
 variables {VNSC, VEWC}

The following provides more documentation of the fit procedure used to determine
 the Schuler oscillation.
 The errors are assumed to result primarily from this oscillation, so the
 three-term fit is of the form

oscillation!Schuler!angular velocity
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x=h_{1}+h_{2}\sin(\Omega_{Sch}t)+h_{3}\cos(\Omega_{Sch}t)$

 , where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{Sch}$
\end_inset

 is the angular frequency of the Schuler oscillation (taken to be 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi/(5067\,s))$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the time since the start of the flight.
 A separate fit is used for each component of the velocity and each component
 of the position (discussed below under LATC and LONC).
 The fit matrix used to determine these coefficients is updated each time
 step but the accumulated fit factors decay exponentially with about 30-min
 decay constant, so the terms used to determine the fit are exponentially
 weighted over the period of valid data with a time constant that decays
 exponentially into the past with a characteristic time of 30 min.
 This is long enough to determine a significant portion of the Schuler oscillati
on but short enough to emphasize recent measurements of the correction.
 The procedures for accumulating the matrices for the fit are as follows:

So that this document might serve as a model for future analyses of uncertainty,
 this appendix documents some of the conventions followed here and suggested
 for standardized use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why perform analyses of uncertainty?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When measurements are made to test scientific theories, provide input to
 models, or characterize nature, they are only useful if accompanied by
 some sense of their reliability.
 A key use of uncertainty analysis is to provide this sense, in as quantitative
 terms as can be justified.
 A quoted value should be considered incomplete unless accompanied by some
 sense of the associated uncertainty.
 A target is to estimate confidence limits to be associated with measurements
 or to be propagated to final scientific results.
 Although it is usually impossible in a strict statistical sense to provide
 formal estimates of confidence limits, this target still underlies approaches
 to uncertainty analysis.
 If those who make measurements don't characterize their reliability, others
 must make their own (probably less informed) evaluations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are additional benefits of analyzing measurement uncertainty.
 If an uncertainty analysis is done before an experiment, it may suggest
 ways to refine the experiment to minimize critical uncertainty contributions,
 and it should be possible to judge if the desired uncertainty is attainable.
 An uncertainty analysis also highlights the dominant sources of error and
 so can guide efforts to improve instruments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Error, accuracy, and uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
error
\emph default
 in a measurement is the difference between the measurement and the correct
 value of the measurand.
 A measurement is of little use unless there is some way of estimating how
 large this error may be.
 This estimate is called the 
\emph on
uncertaint
\emph default
y.

 The uncertainty usually can be estimated in some way from knowledge of
 the performance of an instrument or from calibrations, intercomparisons,
 or statistical analysis of repeated measurements of the same quantity.

Standards for evaluating uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many different measures are used to characterize measurement error, often
 making it difficult to determine which interpretation should be associated
 with a quoted uncertainty.
 However, there is now an established international consensus, defined by
 the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and by the US
 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and this or modified
 forms have also been adopted by many engineering societies.
 Acceptance of this methodology followed decades of debate within engineering
 societies and among international groups, and finally reached standardization
 through the recommendations of the International Committee on Weights and
 Measures.
 The two key publications defining these standards are the

While the methodology described here is consistent with recommendations
 from those publications, it seems appropriate in addition to advocate separate
 estimation of the uncertainty associated with systematic errors because
 the validity of such estimates often depends on judgment and so is much

 Systematic errors can be reduced by better equipment or better calibration

 The true population mean is

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The prevalence of systematic error is a particularly compelling reason to
 follow the methodology advocated here, because that approach features parallel
 treatment of systematic and random errors and focuses attention on their
 different characteristics.
 These separate error sources should be investigated and treated in different
 ways, and should be reported separately.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Analyses of uncertainty are made more difficult when most sources of uncertaint
y are Type-B.
 Evaluation of standard uncertainty for such sources is often subjective,
 based on judgment, and hard to quantify or defend rigorously.
 Repeated calibrations, intercomparisons among different instruments, and
 long-term stability of the calibrations can all provide information on
 Type-B uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error contributions thought to be random may really be systematic, and evaluatin
g their associated uncertainty via Type-A methods may not reveal that dependence.
 An example often cited as a possible source of random error is a dependence
 of an instrument on line voltage, causing fluctuations in the response
 function of an instrument during an experiment.
 However, line voltage fluctuations are seldom random, and are probably
 biased in a particular direction relative to the conditions at the time
 of calibration, so it is likely that in a given experiment or series of
 experiments such fluctuations will introduce a bias.
 Furthermore, such errors are likely to be correlated in time, so the usual
 procedure of assuming random error contributions to be independent for
 different measurements will not be valid.
 Estimating the associated uncertainty via standard Type-A methods can thus
 be misleading in such a case.
 Close inspection of other common sources of error shows that they are often
 biases, and this increases the importance of estimating the associated
 uncertainty appropriately.
 Other examples will be given in later sections.

These are central features of the methodology recommended and used here:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Components introducing uncertainty are classified into two categories, Type-A
 and Type-B (as defined in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), and 
\emph on
standard uncertainties

 are evaluated for each component.
 The estimated coverage associated with these evaluations is, in the case
 of Type-A components, that corresponding to one standard deviation.
 This is not quantifiable in a manner that can be defended rigorously in
 the base of Type-B errors, but estimating a standard uncertainty remains
 a goal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To obtain the combined evaluation of uncertainty resulting from the net
 effects of many uncorrelated sources, the standard uncertainties are combined
 in quadrature,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{2}=\sum_{i}s_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

 and the number of degrees of freedom in the combined uncertainty is estimated
 from the Welch-Satterthwaite equation (cf.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:WS"

\end_inset

)).
 For cases with correlations among components, methods that treat these
 correlations must be used, as specified in a subsequent section.
 A complete uncertainty report should also include an estimate of the number
 of degrees of freedom associated with the result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If some standard uncertainties are asymmetrical, the positive and negative
 values should be combined separately to obtain separate upper and lower
 composite values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The recommended uncertainty to be reported is the combined standard uncertainty,
 evaluated to represent a single standard deviation.
 Other estimates (e.g., that covering a specified level of confidence) can
 be obtained readily from this, provided that the number of degrees-of-freedom
 in the result is also reported.

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on

 The uncertainty report should also include separate estimates of precision
 and bias in the result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An uncertainty report will normally include a tabulated list of sources
 of uncertainty, which should have separate sections for distinct influences
 like those arising from calibration, data collection, and data analysis.
 It is also useful to include associated estimates of precision, degrees
 of freedom, and bias for each contribution shown in the table.
 Such tabulations make it possible to isolate major sources of error, to
 consider the validity of other investigators' estimates of error sources,
 and to repeat the analyses for a new case when only one of the contributions
 has changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important aspect of this methodology is that the degrees of freedom associate
d with cited estimates should be calculated and quoted.
 This becomes important when the number of degrees of freedom in the result
 is small, so that error limits and propagated errors have non-Gaussian
 character.
 Even if it is assumed that the individual measurements are distributed
 according to a Gaussian error distribution, the true standard deviation
 for an average of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 samples, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}$
\end_inset

, is not known and must be estimated from the observations.
 The test statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $t=(\overline{x}-\xi)/S_{n}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{x}$
\end_inset

 is the average of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 measurements, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is the true value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the estimated standard deviation of the average 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{x}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\xi$

, determined from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}=[\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}\overline{x})^{2}/(n(n-1))]^{\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

) will not be Gaussian distributed.
 The appropriate distribution for such averages is the Student-t distribution.
 The difference between the Gaussian and Student-t distributions is generally
 insignificant when the number of degrees of freedom

evaluation of uncertainty is based on statistical analysis of repeated measureme

 Standard statistical measures and approaches including the standard deviation,
 analysis of variance, propagation of error, etc., can provide the needed
 estimate.
 For example, the standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 in repeated measurements of the same quantity leads to an estimate of standard
 uncertainty  
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}=s_{i}$

 Statistical means can also provide the required estimate of the degrees

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Type-A
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to how the estimate is obtained, not to the type of error.
 Type-A evaluations often result in estimates of systematic error.
 For example, a random error affecting calibration of an instrument can
 subsequently produce a systematic error when the instrument is used, but
 the uncertainty can still be estimated via a Type-A evaluation.
 This uncertainty component is therefore Type-A, even though the associated
 error being characterized is systematic.
 This has sometimes been called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 of error: The random error in the calibration procedure becomes a bias
 when that calibration is used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Variability in a measurement may result from random measurement error, but
 it also may result from variability in the quantity being measured.
 Variations in a measurement arising from true variation in the quantity
 being measured cannot be used to estimate random measurement error, although
 they may place upper limits on that error.
 When using a standard devistion in repeated measurements to estimate standard
 uncertainty, it is necessary to correct for any contribution from natural
 variability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly clear example of a Type-A evaluation leading to a proper
 estimate of precision is that where the measurement consists of counting
 discrete events, such as cloud droplets or particles.
 The uncertainty in such measurements is expected to be characterized by
 Poisson statistics if the events occur at times determined from random
 distribution of the droplets in space.

A Type-B evaluation of standard uncertainty is more dependent on judgment
 and experience so it is harder to defendthan Type-A evaluations.
 Some guidance can be obtained from the following, but it must be acknowledged
 that these are imperfect and not quantitative, so another analyst with
 different judgment and experience could well disagree with the estimate.
 In place of statistical measures, information obtained from intercomparisons
 with other instruments, performance against standards,  repeated calibrations,
 stability of the measurements, and specifications of components can all
 contribute to Type-B estimates of uncertainty.
 Nevertheless, it is useful to attempt to make Type-B evaluations that are
 as far as possible comparable to Type-A evaluations.
 For example, it is a goal that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

coverage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the estimate be comparable to a standard deviation.
 The following may provide some guidance when developing such estimates:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the error source is expected to be within the limits 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm a$

 50% of the time, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{j}\approx1.5a$

\begin_layout Itemize
If it is expected to be within those limits about 2/3 of the time, then

\begin_layout Itemize
If the quantity is expected to be within those limits 100% of the time,
 but equally probable anywhere in this range, then use 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{j}\approx a/\surd3$

The interesting quantities for research are often derived from the basic
 measurements by calculations that combine many measurements into final
 quantities, transform the measurements, apply filters, or otherwise convert
 the fundamental measurements into derived quantities.
 In such cases, the uncertainty characteristics of the derived quantities
 can become quite complicated and difficult to understand without a prescribed
 methodology, and serious errors in interpretation can result.
 For example, some attempts to derive correlations between radar reflectivity
 (
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

) and rainfall (
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

) have been distorted by the problem that both are based on different calculatio
ns from the same characteristics of the drop size distributions, and hence
 there is a natural correlation between the two that arises purely from
 correlated error sources.
 If data sources are used that provide imprecise estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, a correlation will appear that is purely the result of these correlated
 error contributions and does not reflect a natural correlation between
 radar reflectivity and rainfall rate.
 It would be a serious error to use the correlation determined in this way
 to estimate rainfall from radar reflectivity.

\begin_layout Standard
The following develops a consistent approach, often called

Experimental configuration for measuring temperature with a thermocouple.
 Junctions J1 and J2 are junctions between copper and constantan wire, so
 the voltage V1 is a measure of the temperature difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}$
\end_inset

.
 A thermistor R
\begin_inset Formula $_{t}$
\end_inset

 measures the bath temperature via the voltage V2, and so provides a reference
 temperature to be added to the temperature difference measured by the thermocou
ple.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thermocouple junctions both produce voltage differences, dependent respectiv
ely on the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and on the reference bath temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}$
\end_inset

.
 The reason for using this arrangement is that both the wires leading to
 the instrument measuring the voltage 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are then copper wires, and can connect to copper junctions at the voltmeter
 without introducing additional contact potentials such as would result
 if the constantan wire were connected directly to the voltmeter.
 The uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is then caused by two sources: (a) the uncertainty in the measurement of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $T-T_{ref}$
\end_inset

, and (b) the uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}$
\end_inset

.
 Often, a thermistor is used to measure the temperature of the reference
 bath (or of a metal block used in the same way).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a thermistor is used to determine the temperature of the reference junction,
 as shown, there are two voltages that must be measured to determine the
 unknown temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

, produced by the pair of thermocouples, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

, produced by the thermistor.
 These are related to the temperature difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

=(
\begin_inset Formula $T-T_{ref}$
\end_inset

) and to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

, the temperature of the thermistor junction, by functions 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{2}$
\end_inset

, which often are almost linear relationships: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta T=Y_{1}(V_{1})=a_{1}V_{1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{2}=Y_{2}(V_{2})=a_{2}V_{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then the first two fundamental quantities affecting the measurement, in
 the earlier notation, are 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=V_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=V_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

 are measured by the same voltmeter, part of the uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

 will be correlated with that in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 because bias in the voltmeter will affect both measurements in the same
 way.
 This will be reflected in off-diagonal terms in the error matrix, representing
 correlations between errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There will also be an error in the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 introduced by the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}=T_{2}$
\end_inset

, because the temperature bath or constant-temperature block may not be
 uniform in temperature.
 Another function 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{3}=x_{3}=T_{ref}-T_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be introduced to account for this error source, which probably will
 be a systematic error.
 The measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is then determined from 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T=\Delta T+(T_{ref}-T_{2})+T_{2}=Y_{1}(V_{1})+Y_{2}(V_{2})+Y_{3}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the voltmeter has a precision of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

 and a systematic error of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}$
\end_inset

 when measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

, and that the random errors are uncorrelated but the bias errors are always
 the same (as might occur for a calibration error).
 If the only sources of error are these random and systematic errors and
 a non-zero value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{3}$
\end_inset

, the error matrix for the random component of the uncertainty is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H_{r}^{-1}=\left(\begin{matrix}S_{1}^{2}\end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the bias component is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H_{s}^{-1}=\left(\begin{matrix}(B_{1}^{2}\end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

when expressed in terms of the fundamental quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

 representing the two measurements and the unmeasured difference between
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sum of these matrices can be used in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:refa"

\end_inset

) to evaluate the variance in the measured temperature: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{TT}=\begin{pmatrix}a_{1}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}S_{1}^{2}+B_{1}^{2}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}a_{1}\\
a_{2}\\
1
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
~~~~~=a_{1}^{2}S_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}S_{2}^{2}+(a_{1}B_{1}+a_{2}B_{2})^{2}+B_{3}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The first two terms show that the random contributions add to the net variance
 in quadrature, as expected for independent error sources.
 The next term shows that the bias contributions, however, add linearly.
 This results because a bias error affects measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the same way, so the error enters the final result additively.

 In such cases, an alternative is to employ what is conventionally called
 a

Monte Carlo
\shape default
 technique.
 In this approach, the measured quantities are varied randomly in ways that
 represent the experimental uncertainties, and the calculations leading
 to the final answer are repeated with these artificial quantities.
 This is done repeatedly, and the variances and covariances in the resulting
 final answers are calculated.
 Random number generators are available on computer systems that generate
 variables having zero mean, unity variance, and a Gaussian probability
 distribution.
 Correlated fluctuations can be represented by defining linear combinations
 of such independent variables.
 In cases where the error propagation is especially complex (e.g, where the
 final answer might depend on non-linear fits to the input data), Monte
 Carlo techniques may be the only feasible way of determining the uncertainty
 in the final result.

\begin_layout Standard
There is an important distinction to be made between the standard deviation
 characterizing the random error of a measurement and the standard deviation
 characterizing a set of accurate observations and hence reflecting physical
 reality.
 The latter is often encountered in experimental research, and pertains
 to the natural variability in the parameter being measured; e.g., the temperature
 may really vary when measured over a path through the atmosphere.
 The former represents the precision with which a constant value of that
 parameter could be measured in a particular experiment.
 For example, in experiments using airborne instrumentation variance spectra
 for measured variables seldom show evidence of noise except at low levels
 that correspond to digitization noise.
 This indicates that random measurement errors seldom contribute significantly
 to the uncertainty in such a measurement.
 However, there usually is high natural variability that causes repeated
 sets of measurements in presumably identical conditions to vary significantly,
 and the standard deviations among repeated measurements of, for example,
 fluxes of water vapor are large.
 This standard deviation reflects natural variability, not the random error
 in the measurement.
 It results from the variability of particular samples about the underlying
 population mean, and that variability would still characterize measurements
 from error-free sensors.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\shape italic
median
\shape default
 is the value that divides the population into equal halves; i.e., half the
 members lie above and half below the median.
 The 
\shape italic
most probable value
\shape default
 is that observed most frequently, sometimes referred to as the 
\shape italic
mode
\shape default
 of a distribution.
 As an example, the expected distribution of time intervals between randomly

\sigma^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}(x_{j}-\mu)^{2}\Phi(x_{j})=\Bigl(\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{j}^{2}\Phi(x_{j})\Bigr)-\mu^{2}=\langle x^{2}\rangle-\mu^{2}.

The extensions to continuous distribution functions are these: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j}P(x_{j})\rightarrow\int P(x)dx
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{2}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^{2}\Phi(x)dx.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly, the expectation value for any function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 of measurable characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\langle f(x)\rangle=\int f(x)\Phi(x)dx
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 can be a set of variables and the multidimensional integration must then
 cover all possible values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

Other characteristics sometimes cited are the

, the magnitude of the deviation exceeded by 50% of the deviations, and
 the 
\shape italic
average deviation,
\shape default
 the expectation value for the absolute magnitude of the deviations.
 For a Gaussian distribution, the probable error, average deviation, and
 standard deviation have the ratios 0.674:0.800:1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the distribution in measurement errors follows a known probability distributi
on, then 
\shape italic
confidence intervals
\shape default
 determined from that distribution can be used to obtain quantitative estimates
 of probabilities associated with such errors.
 It is this relationship that establishes the often used correspondence
 between standard deviation and probability, for the Gaussian distribution.
 Specifically, measurements falling more than two standard deviations (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm2\sigma$
\end_inset

) from the true value are expected with about 0.05 probability, so 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sigma$
\end_inset

 limits correspond to approximate limits providing 95% coverage.
 Other distribution functions can be treated in the same way.

The normal high-rate output for wind components is 25

 However, the different measurements entering the calculation of wind are
 available at various sampling frequencies, so these must be converted to
 a common rate.
 The most important contributors to high-frequency variance are the measurements
 of dynamic pressure (QCF) and the pressure differences (ADIFR and BDIFR)
 measured at the radome.
 These are measured at 50

The other wind-sensing systems on the GV can help provide valid measurements
 of high-frequency components of the variance spectra of winds.
 The gust pod has very short pressure lines and a sensing head that is much
 smaller than the radome, and the LAMS also can measure the longitudinal
 component of the relative wind at high frequency.
 In the case of the gust pod, this report concludes that the horizontal
 wind measurements have serious weaknesses arising primarily from the inertial
 reference unit used for its measurements, but those give slowly varying
 biases so it might be expected that the high-frequency spectrum for the
 longitudinal component of the wind would be measured better by the gust
 pod than by the radome.

 shows the variance spectra for the gust-pod dynamic pressure (QC_GP) and
 for the radome-system dynamic pressure (QCF).
 This comparison shows that there appears to be noise in the radome-system
 measurement at high frequency but the gust=pod measurement looks reasonable
 up to about 10
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz.
 (The reduced amplitude for QC_GP at frequencies lower than about 0.1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz arises from the reduction in dynamic pressure measured under the wing
 because of disturbed airflow.
 This is corrected when the gust-pod true airspeed TAS_GP is calculated.)
 To see how this is reflected in the wind measurements and in a proposed
 new variable that blends measurements from the gust-pod and radome systems,
 these steps were used:

 in Sect.

.
 There the fit was restricted to measurements at high flight levels because
 that was of primary interest to DEEPWAVE
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

, but for measurements in the boundary layer this needs to be repeated.
 The same equation was used to represent the fit, and the fit used the measureme
nts from flight 3 of the HCRTEST
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 program were used, but all measurements with conventionally measured true
 airspeed (TASF) above 130
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s and magnitude of the roll angle less than 
\begin_inset Formula $5^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 were used.
 A fit of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:TASfit"

\end_inset

 to these measurements then produced coefficients from which the ratio of
 dynamic to static pressure could be determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
As in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:GP-TAS"

\end_inset

, this ratio of pressures then was used to calculate the true airspeed (TAS_GP)
 in the standard way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This airspeed, with the other measurements from the gust pod, was then used
 to recalculate the relative wind and then, as explained earlier in this
 document, the wind direction and magnitude and the various wind components
 including vartical and horizontal lateral and longitudinal components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Next, new wind variables were calculated, labeled with suffix "M" for "merged",
 that combined each component of the measurements from the gust-pod and
 the radome systems, using the technique described in Sect.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:comp-filter"

\end_inset

.
 For 50-Hz measurements, the time constant used was 150 samples or 3
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s.
 This then resulted in measurements that combined the small low-frequency
 uncertainty of the radome measurements and the good high-frequency response
 of the gust-pod measurements.
 Because the complementary-filter technique uses a cross-over between components
 at a frequency where both signals are thought to be valid and show high
 coherence and similar amplitudes, no phase shift or other spurious effect
 on the variance spectra at the cross-over frequency is expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result was that a variable TAS_GP representing the true airspeed from
 the gust pod was obtained that, for measurements where TASF exceeded 130
 m/s and the absolute value of the roll was less than 5
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}$
\end_inset

, matched the mean TASF from the radome-based sysem with a standard error
 of 0.26
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

m/s.
 This also led to new variables representing the wind from the gust pod
 and also a new longitudinal-wind variable

Variance spectra for the three components of the wind represented by UXM
 (longitudinal component as recalculated by combining the gust-pod true
 airspeed and the radome-based true airspeed, as discussed in the text),
 VYC (the conventional lateral component of the horizontal wind), and WIC
 (the conventional measurement of vertical wind).
 The two lateral combonents (VYC and WIC) have been multiplied by 0.75 to
 make them comparable to the longitudinal component in relation to the indicated
 reference lines for eddy dissipation rate (green lines), which are shown
 with magnitudes applicable to the longitudinal component.

, where the longitudinal component of the horizontal wind is calculated
 as described above by combining measurements from the gust-pod and the
 radome-based systems.
 The lateral components have been scaled by a factor of 3/4 because the
 variance spectra for longitudinal and lateral components are expected to
 be in the ratio 3:4 in an inertial subrange (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

) so this adjustment should make the spectra coincide.
 From 1--10

\begin_layout Standard
The conclusion from this appendix is that the lateral components of the
 wind measurements appear reasonable up to a frequency of about 10
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz, but the longitudinal wind component should not be used at frequencies
 above about 1
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

Hz.
 For higher frequencies, a useful measurement of the longitudinal wind can
 be obtained by calculating a new true airspeed obtained by combining the
 high-frequency response from the gust pod with the low-frequency response
 from the standard radome system and then calculating the wind using this
 blended variable.
 There is evidence of noise in all wind measurements for frequencies above
 about 10
