Introduction

\begin_layout Subsection
Why perform analyses of uncertainty?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When measurements are made to test scientific theories, provide input to
 models, or characterize nature, they are only useful if accompanied by
 some sense of their reliability.
 A key use of uncertainty analysis is to provide this sense, in as quantitative
 terms as can be justified.
 A quoted value should be considered incomplete unless accompanied by some
 sense of the associated uncertainty.
 A target is to estimate confidence limits to be associated with measurements
 or to be propagated to final scientific results.
 Although it is usually impossible in a strict statistical sense to provide
 formal estimates of confidence limits, this target still underlies approaches
 to uncertainty analysis.
 If those who make measurements don't characterize their reliability, others
 must make their own (probably less informed) evaluations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are additional benefits of analyzing measurement uncertainty.
 If an uncertainty analysis is done before an experiment, it may suggest
 ways to refine the experiment to minimize critical uncertainty contributions,
 and it should be possible to judge if the desired uncertainty is attainable.
 An uncertainty analysis also highlights the dominant sources of error and
 so can guide efforts to improve instruments.

 The uncertainty usually can be estimated in some way from knowledge of

\begin_layout Subsection
Standards for evaluating uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many different measures are used to characterize measurement error, often
 making it difficult to determine which interpretation should be associated
 with a quoted uncertainty.
 However, there is now an established international consensus, defined by
 the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and by the US
 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and this or modified
 forms have also been adopted by many engineering societies.
 Acceptance of this methodology followed decades of debate within engineering
 societies and among international groups, and finally reached standardization
 through the recommendations of the International Committee on Weights and
 Measures.
 The two key publications defining these standards are the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement"
target "http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=50461"

\end_inset

 (often referred to as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

GUM
\begin_inset Quotes erd

) and NIST Technical Note 1297 [1994 revision], 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "“Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results.”"
target "http://www.nist.gov/pml/pubs/tn1297/index.cfm"

\end_inset

 The latter is available in full from the web link and will be the primary
 reference followed in this document.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While the methodology described here is consistent with recommendations
 from those publications, it seems appropriate in addition to advocate separate
 estimation of the uncertainty associated with systematic errors because
 the validity of such estimates often depends on judgment and so is much
 harder to defend than in the case of random error.

 are expected to average to zero in a repeated series of measurements.
 The former are also called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

biases
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when they arise from characteristics of an instrument.
 It is straightforward to differentiate these error classes by this test:
 Random errors are reduced when an experiment is repeated many times and
 the results averaged together, while systematic errors remain the same.
 Systematic errors can be reduced by better equipment or better calibration
 or better experimental procedures.

Illustration of the separate effects of bias errors and random errors.
 The true population mean is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and measures with random error (in each observation) 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting estimate of the mean, obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{x}$
\end_inset

, is in error because of the separate contributions of the bias error 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and the random error in the measurement of the mean, in this case 
\begin_inset Formula $(\overline{x}-a)$
\end_inset

.
 The precision of the instrument is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, so the estimated random error in the mean is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma/{N}^{1/2}$
\end_inset

.
 The actual error in an experiment is the difference between the true value
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and the measured value

 The histogram represents a frequency distribution measured in a particular

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The prevalence of systematic error is a particularly compelling reason to
 follow the methodology advocated here, because that approach features parallel
 treatment of systematic and random errors and focuses attention on their
 different characteristics.
 These separate error sources should be investigated and treated in different
 ways, and should be reported separately.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Analyses of uncertainty are made more difficult when most sources of uncertaint
y are Type-B.
 Evaluation of standard uncertainty for such sources is often subjective,
 based on judgment, and hard to quantify or defend rigorously.
 Repeated calibrations, intercomparisons among different instruments, and
 long-term stability of the calibrations can all provide information on
 Type-B uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Error contributions thought to be random may really be systematic, and evaluatin
g their associated uncertainty via Type-A methods may not reveal that dependence.
 An example often cited as a possible source of random error is a dependence
 of an instrument on line voltage, causing fluctuations in the response
 function of an instrument during an experiment.
 However, line voltage fluctuations are seldom random, and are probably
 biased in a particular direction relative to the conditions at the time
 of calibration, so it is likely that in a given experiment or series of
 experiments such fluctuations will introduce a bias.
 Furthermore, such errors are likely to be correlated in time, so the usual
 procedure of assuming random error contributions to be independent for
 different measurements will not be valid.
 Estimating the associated uncertainty via standard Type-A methods can thus
 be misleading in such a case.
 Close inspection of other common sources of error shows that they are often
 biases, and this increases the importance of estimating the associated
 uncertainty appropriately.
 Other examples will be given in later sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Recommended Guidelines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are central features of the methodology recommended and used here:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Components introducing uncertainty are classified into two categories, Type-A
 and Type-B (as defined in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Classification-of-sources"

\end_inset

), and 
\emph on
standard uncertainties
\emph default
 are evaluated for each component.
 The estimated coverage associated with these evaluations is, in the case
 of Type-A components, that corresponding to one standard deviation.
 This is not quantifiable in a manner that can be defended rigorously in
 the base of Type-B errors, but estimating a standard uncertainty remains
 a goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To obtain the combined evaluation of uncertainty resulting from the net
 effects of many uncorrelated sources, the standard uncertainties are combined
 in quadrature,
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{2}=\sum_{i}s_{i}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the number of degrees of freedom in the combined uncertainty is estimated
 from the Welch-Satterthwaite equation (cf.
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "eq:WS"

\end_inset

)).
 For cases with correlations among components, methods that treat these
 correlations must be used, as specified in a subsequent section.
 A complete uncertainty report should also include an estimate of the number
 of degrees of freedom associated with the result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If some standard uncertainties are asymmetrical, the positive and negative
 values should be combined separately to obtain separate upper and lower
 composite values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The recommended uncertainty to be reported is the combined standard uncertainty,
 evaluated to represent a single standard deviation.
 Other estimates (e.g., that covering a specified level of confidence) can
 be obtained readily from this, provided that the number of degrees-of-freedom
 in the result is also reported.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
[Not part of the standard:]
\emph default
 The uncertainty report should also include separate estimates of precision
 and bias in the result.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An uncertainty report will normally include a tabulated list of sources
 of uncertainty, which should have separate sections for distinct influences
 like those arising from calibration, data collection, and data analysis.
 It is also useful to include associated estimates of precision, degrees
 of freedom, and bias for each contribution shown in the table.
 Such tabulations make it possible to isolate major sources of error, to
 consider the validity of other investigators' estimates of error sources,
 and to repeat the analyses for a new case when only one of the contributions
 has changed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important aspect of this methodology is that the degrees of freedom associate
d with cited estimates should be calculated and quoted.
 This becomes important when the number of degrees of freedom in the result
 is small, so that error limits and propagated errors have non-Gaussian
 character.
 Even if it is assumed that the individual measurements are distributed
 according to a Gaussian error distribution, the true standard deviation
 for an average of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 samples, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}$
\end_inset

, is not known and must be estimated from the observations.
 The test statistic 
\begin_inset Formula $t=(\overline{x}-\xi)/S_{n}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{x}$
\end_inset

 is the average of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 measurements, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is the true value of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the estimated standard deviation of the average 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{x}$
\end_inset

 about 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

, determined from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{n}=[\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}\overline{x})^{2}/(n(n-1))]^{\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

) will not be Gaussian distributed.
 The appropriate distribution for such averages is the Student-t distribution.
 The difference between the Gaussian and Student-t distributions is generally
 insignificant when the number of degrees of freedom

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the case of an average of n values, the number of degrees of freedom
 is

 exceeds about thirty, but for small sample sizes the differences can be
 quite important.
 For this reason, when 
\begin_inset Formula $n<30$
\end_inset

, the confidence limits used should be taken from the Student-t distribution
 rather than from the normal distribution.

Type-A evaluation

\begin_layout Standard
A Type-A evaluation of uncertainty is based on statistical analysis of repeated
 measurements or knowledge of the statistical character of the observations.
 Standard statistical measures and approaches including the standard deviation,
 analysis of variance, propagation of error, etc., can provide the needed
 estimate.
 For example, the standard deviation 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 in repeated measurements of the same quantity leads to an estimate of standard 
uncertainty  
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}=s_{i}$
\end_inset

. Statistical means can also provide the required estimate of the degrees
 of freedom associated with the standard uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Type-A

 refers to how the estimate is obtained, not to the type of error.
 Type-A evaluations often result in estimates of systematic error.
 For example, a random error affecting calibration of an instrument can
 subsequently produce a systematic error when the instrument is used, but
 the uncertainty can still be estimated via a Type-A evaluation.
 This uncertainty component is therefore Type-A, even though the associated
 error being characterized is systematic.
 This has sometimes been called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fossilization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of error: The random error in the calibration procedure becomes a bias
 when that calibration is used.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Variability in a measurement may result from random measurement error, but
 it also may result from variability in the quantity being measured.
 Variations in a measurement arising from true variation in the quantity
 being measured cannot be used to estimate random measurement error, although
 they may place upper limits on that error.
 When using a standard devistion in repeated measurements to estimate standard
 uncertainty, it is necessary to correct for any contribution from natural
 variability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly clear example of a Type-A evaluation leading to a proper
 estimate of precision is that where the measurement consists of counting
 discrete events, such as cloud droplets or particles.
 The uncertainty in such measurements is expected to be characterized by
 Poisson statistics if the events occur at times determined from random
 distribution of the droplets in space.

\begin_layout Subsection
Type-B evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
A Type-B evaluation of standard uncertainty is more dependent on judgment
 and experience so it is harder to defendthan Type-A evaluations.
 Some guidance can be obtained from the following, but it must be acknowledged
 that these are imperfect and not quantitative, so another analyst with
 different judgment and experience could well disagree with the estimate.
 In place of statistical measures, information obtained from intercomparisons
 with other instruments, performance against standards,  repeated calibrations,
 stability of the measurements, and specifications of components can all
 contribute to Type-B estimates of uncertainty.
 Nevertheless, it is useful to attempt to make Type-B evaluations that are
 as far as possible comparable to Type-A evaluations.
 For example, it is a goal that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

coverage
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the estimate be comparable to a standard deviation.
 The following may provide some guidance when developing such estimates:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the error source is expected to be within the limits 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm a$
\end_inset

 50% of the time, then 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{j}\approx1.5a$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If it is expected to be within those limits about 2/3 of the time, then
 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{j}\approx a$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the quantity is expected to be within those limits 100% of the time,
 but equally probable anywhere in this range, then use 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{j}\approx a/\surd3$

\begin_layout Itemize
If the limits are interpreted as 3-standard-deviation limits, then

Propagation of uncertainty estimates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interesting quantities for research are often derived from the basic
 measurements by calculations that combine many measurements into final
 quantities, transform the measurements, apply filters, or otherwise convert
 the fundamental measurements into derived quantities.
 In such cases, the uncertainty characteristics of the derived quantities
 can become quite complicated and difficult to understand without a prescribed
 methodology, and serious errors in interpretation can result.
 For example, some attempts to derive correlations between radar reflectivity
 (
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

) and rainfall (
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

) have been distorted by the problem that both are based on different calculatio
ns from the same characteristics of the drop size distributions, and hence
 there is a natural correlation between the two that arises purely from
 correlated error sources.
 If data sources are used that provide imprecise estimates of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, a correlation will appear that is purely the result of these correlated
 error contributions and does not reflect a natural correlation between
 radar reflectivity and rainfall rate.
 It would be a serious error to use the correlation determined in this way
 to estimate rainfall from radar reflectivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following develops a consistent approach, often called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

error propagation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 that makes it possible to determine the uncertainty characteristics in
 derived quantities if the characteristics of the fundamental measurements
 are known.
 Let

Experimental configuration for measuring temperature with a thermocouple.
 Junctions J1 and J2 are junctions between copper and constantan wire, so
 the voltage V1 is a measure of the temperature difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}$
\end_inset

.
 A thermistor R
\begin_inset Formula $_{t}$
\end_inset

 measures the bath temperature via the voltage V2, and so provides a reference
 temperature to be added to the temperature difference measured by the thermocou
ple.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 The thermocouple junctions both produce voltage differences, dependent
 respectively on the temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 and on the reference bath temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}$
\end_inset

.
 The reason for using this arrangement is that both the wires leading to
 the instrument measuring the voltage 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 are then copper wires, and can connect to copper junctions at the voltmeter
 without introducing additional contact potentials such as would result
 if the constantan wire were connected directly to the voltmeter.
 The uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is then caused by two sources: (a) the uncertainty in the measurement of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $T-T_{ref}$
\end_inset

, and (b) the uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}$
\end_inset

.
 Often, a thermistor is used to measure the temperature of the reference
 bath (or of a metal block used in the same way).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a thermistor is used to determine the temperature of the reference junction,
 as shown, there are two voltages that must be measured to determine the
 unknown temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

, produced by the pair of thermocouples, and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

, produced by the thermistor.
 These are related to the temperature difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

=(
\begin_inset Formula $T-T_{ref}$
\end_inset

) and to 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

, the temperature of the thermistor junction, by functions 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{2}$
\end_inset

, which often are almost linear relationships: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta T=Y_{1}(V_{1})=a_{1}V_{1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{2}=Y_{2}(V_{2})=a_{2}V_{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Then the first two fundamental quantities affecting the measurement, in
 the earlier notation, are 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}=V_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}=V_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

 are measured by the same voltmeter, part of the uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

 will be correlated with that in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 because bias in the voltmeter will affect both measurements in the same
 way.
 This will be reflected in off-diagonal terms in the error matrix, representing
 correlations between errors in 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There will also be an error in the measurement of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 introduced by the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}=T_{2}$
\end_inset

, because the temperature bath or constant-temperature block may not be
 uniform in temperature.
 Another function 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{3}=x_{3}=T_{ref}-T_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be introduced to account for this error source, which probably will
 be a systematic error.
 The measurement 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is then determined from 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T=\Delta T+(T_{ref}-T_{2})+T_{2}=Y_{1}(V_{1})+Y_{2}(V_{2})+Y_{3}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the voltmeter has a precision of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}$
\end_inset

 and a systematic error of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}$
\end_inset

 when measuring 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i}$
\end_inset

, and that the random errors are uncorrelated but the bias errors are always
 the same (as might occur for a calibration error).
 If the only sources of error are these random and systematic errors and
 a non-zero value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{3}$
\end_inset

, the error matrix for the random component of the uncertainty is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H_{r}^{-1}=\left(\begin{matrix}S_{1}^{2}\end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the bias component is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H_{s}^{-1}=\left(\begin{matrix}(B_{1}^{2}\end{matrix}\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 when expressed in terms of the fundamental quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

 representing the two measurements and the unmeasured difference between
 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ref}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sum of these matrices can be used in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:refa"

\end_inset

) to evaluate the variance in the measured temperature: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{TT}=\begin{pmatrix}a_{1}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}S_{1}^{2}+B_{1}^{2}\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}a_{1}\cr a_{2}\cr1\cr\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
~~~~~=a_{1}^{2}S_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}S_{2}^{2}+(a_{1}B_{1}+a_{2}B_{2})^{2}+B_{3}^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The first two terms show that the random contributions add to the net variance
 in quadrature, as expected for independent error sources.
 The next term shows that the bias contributions, however, add linearly.
 This results because a bias error affects measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta T$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the same way, so the error enters the final result additively.

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes the functional relationships are so complex or non-linear that
 the preceding analytical formulas are unwieldy.
 In such cases, an alternative is to employ what is conventionally called
 a 
\shape italic
Monte Carlo
\shape default
 technique.
 In this approach, the measured quantities are varied randomly in ways that
 represent the experimental uncertainties, and the calculations leading
 to the final answer are repeated with these artificial quantities.
 This is done repeatedly, and the variances and covariances in the resulting
 final answers are calculated.
 Random number generators are available on computer systems that generate
 variables having zero mean, unity variance, and a Gaussian probability
 distribution.
 Correlated fluctuations can be represented by defining linear combinations
 of such independent variables.
 In cases where the error propagation is especially complex (e.g, where the
 final answer might depend on non-linear fits to the input data), Monte
 Carlo techniques may be the only feasible way of determining the uncertainty
 in the final result.

 flight conditions like changes in flight speed, aircraft weight, angle
 of attack, etc.
 The main challenge is thus to correct for the static defect present under
 various flight conditions.

Calibration and Data Handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Parascientific Model 1000 pressure transducer is calibrated periodically
 with reference to a Bell and Howell dead-weight pressure source, which
 is also recalibrated on a five-year cycle.
 A transfer standard, a Rosemount 1501MD2, is used to check the calibration
 on the aircraft.
 The transducer on the aircraft has remained steady and within the manufacturer
 specifications in such calibrations, within the uncertainty of the calibration,
 so the nominal calibration is used in data processing to obtain the directly
 measured pressure 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{f}$
\end_inset

.
 A correction is then applied, in the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
p_{c}=p_{f}+\Delta p\label{eq:StaticDefectEquation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

to obtain a corrected measurement of the ambient pressure (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

) that takes into account the static defect (
\begin_inset Formula $-\Delta p$
\end_inset

) in the pressure delivered by the fuselage static buttons to the pressure
 transducer.
 The following sections discuss methods for determining the static defect,
 which will be shown to be the dominant source of uncertainty in the pressure
 measurement.

Determination of the static defect using measurements from a trailing cone

\begin_layout Standard
The standard method for the calibration of a pressure sensor on a research
 aircraft involves the use of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

trailing cone
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to provide a reference static-pressure source free of the influences of
 the aircraft.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 provided a thorough history of the trailing cone and its application to
 NCAR research aircraft.
 A trailing-cone consists of a tube, with pressure ports along its side,
 that is trailed (with the help of drag from a cone) behind the aircraft
 at a distance that places it outside the disturbed flow of the aircraft.
 This reference pressure is then compared to the pressure sensor being studied
 to determine the static defect, usually as a function of flight conditions
 including Mach number, angle of attack, sideslip, and pressure.
 The trailing-cone pressure source is then connected to a transducer, usually
 a differential transducer that measures the difference between this source
 and the one being calibrated.
 This measures the required correction 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 needed in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:StaticDefectEquation"

\end_inset

) above.
 This correction needs to be measured over a range of flight conditions
 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

 can be represented as a function of flight characteristics spanning the
 operating range of the aircraft.
 Then that parametric representation of the correction can be applied to
 measurements when the trailing cone is not present.

 sensor being calibrated (specifically in this case, a Rosemount 1221 differenti
al transducer) can isolate the airflow-induced difference and measure it
 with less uncertainty than would be obtained from the comparison of two
 absolute sensors.
 In addition, other checks (comparisons to other sensors, intercalibration
 flights, measurements during flights past towers carrying instruments,
 etc.) are usually used to develop confidence in the pressure measurement
 and to characterize its uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The set-up used here determined the static defect of a Rosemount 1201 pressure
 transducer connected to the wing static source via comparison to a Rosemount
 1501 transducer connected to the fuselage static source of the aircraft.
 In addition, a differential 1221 sensor was connected between the fuselage
 source and the trailing-cone source to determine the static defect of the
 fuselage measurement.
 Once the static defect of the fuselage-port sensor was determined, that
 measurement could be used to determine the static defect of the wing-mounted
 sensor.
 To proceed in this way, it is necessary to characterize the measurement
 uncertainty associated with each of the sensors and with the trailing-cone
 source.
 For simplicity, the three measurements will be referred to as the fuselage-moun
ted measurement, the wing-mounted measurement, and the differential measurement.
 The best estimate of the

where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{f}$
\end_inset

\begin{equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Normal measurements are made without the trailing cone in place, so some
 functional form needs to be determined for representing 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta p$
\end_inset

 in the absence of the differential measurement.
 The static pressure is then estimated from 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{s}=P_{w}+\delta p$
\end_inset

.
 In this form, the uncertainty includes contributions from the measurement
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{w}$
\end_inset

 as well as from uncertainties in functional representation of the static
 defect.
 Note, however, that some uncertainty sources affecting 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{w}$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{w}$

 is calibrated to match

On 14 September 2006, a flight of almost 7 h duration was flown with a trailing
 cone system on the GV.
 The pressure ports on the trailing-cone source were connected via a long
 tube to a differential pressure sensor that measured the difference relative
 to the research pressure ports on the aircraft.
 The flight was long because it extended from Colorado over the Gulf of
 Mexico in order to collect low-level measurements.
 Flight segments were flown at various airspeeds spanning the available

 This fit represented 95% of the variance in the measurements as given by
 (

), leaving a residual standard deviation in (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}^{*}-p_{c})$
\end_inset

 of about 0.3 hPa.
 A variety of additional terms were tested without finding a method for
 reducing this residual standard deviation to any significant extent.

It is thought that this residual standard deviation is mostly caused by
 differences between the locations of the LAMS sample volume and the pitot-tube
 samples.
 Because these were separated by about 16 m, turbulent fluctuations in the
 wind at this scale would create a residual standard deviation that could
 not be removed by improving the fit, and measurements of turbulent motions
 supported this possibility.

 However, the large number of measurements entering this fit allowed the
 listed coefficients to be determined with considerable precision, with
 associated uncertainty smaller than 1% in each.

The fit results for

 and the equivalent correction to dynamic pressure were then subjected to
 a number of tests, including comparison to the FAA-certified pressure system
 on the GV, tests of wind measurements that compared measurements before
 and after course reversal, and d-value measurements in speed runs.
 These tests each had higher uncertainty than that expected for the corrections
 determined from LAMS, but they could identify any major discrepancies.

The uncertainty that was introduced by this procedure will be discussed
 in connection with the tabulation of error sources that follows.
 However, there is one troubling aspect evident by comparing this and the
 preceding trailing-cone results.

 The formulas are in rather serious disagreement, as shown in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:TCvsLAMS"

\end_inset

.
 The results are about 1.05 hPa different in means, and the difference has
 about 0.6 hPa standard deviation.
 This difference and standard deviation are both much larger than expected
 from the estimated accuracy of each determination.
 A further hint is that the complexity of the formulas required to represent
 the measurements is quite different, with the trailing cone measurements
 requiring more terms and some complex interactions (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Delta p_{\alpha}/q_{r})^{4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Delta p_{\alpha}/q_{r})M^{4}$
\end_inset

 in the case of the trailing cone, both of which produced significant reductions
 in the standard error of the fit) while those same terms had negligible
 effect on the fit to the measurements from the LAMS.
 Because it has not yet been possible to fly these two calibration systems
 at the same time, it is difficult to resolve the difference observed.
 There are many possibilities: The change in aircraft configuration (with
 wing stores present during the flight with LAMS and a significantly larger
 payload) might have affected the static defect, making the LAMS-based calibrati
on invalid for this flight; the trailing cone might have been too close
 to the aircraft, leading to the observed complex dependence on angle of
 attack, there might have been significant changes in the sensitivity coefficien
ts for the radome (although this was checked to the degree that the flight
 data from the trailing-cone flight permit), there might have been leaks
 that could be particularly serious for high-altitude flight and so could
 contribute to the scatter seen for the low values of static defect that
 mostly correlate with high-altitude flight, etc.
 Even though the two calibrations agree to within about a hPa, which would
 normally be a very good result, it appears that especially the LAMS calibration
 has lower uncertainty than this so a repeated flight with both LAMS and
 the trailing cone could be quite helpful in resolving the source of this
 troublesome difference between the calibrations.

There is a plot of the radome calibration, and I tried correcting for the
 indicated difference in interpretation of how ADIFR/QCR affects the result,
 but that did not improve the agreement.
 I also compared to PS_A, which was closer to the TC result than the LAMS
 result.
 Mean corrections were -1.76 (TC), -2.81 (LAMS), -0.87 (PS_A-PSF).

 Production of standard pressure by a dead-weight standard.

 Bell and Howell provide an uncertainty specification for the dead-weight
 standard (3-

) of 0.015%, so at 1000 mb this translates to a standard uncertainty of 0.05
 mb.
 This standard is recertified every five years by the Bureau of Naval Weapons.
 There are other factors that affect the accuracy of the standard, including
 a correction made for gravity at the calibration site, but these are covered
 by the above estimate.

Description of the measurement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Basic principles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurement of temperature from an aircraft is complicated by dynamic
 heating, which causes the temperature of a sensor exposed to the airstream
 to be higher than that of the temperature in the free airstream.
 If the airspeed is slowed to a fraction f of the free-stream airspeed at
 the location where it is in thermal contact with the sensor, the (absolute)
 temperature of the sensor (Ts) differs from that in the free airstream
 (Ta) according to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{s}=T_{a}+\frac{V^{2}(1-f^{2})}{2C_{p}}\label{Ts}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where V is the airspeed and Cp is the heat capacity of air at constant pressure.
 Because determining V requires knowledge of the air temperature, a more
 suitable formula for error analysis is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{a}=\frac{T_{s}}{1+\frac{rRM^{s}}{2C_{v}}}\label{eq:Ta}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where Cv is the specific heat of air at constant volume, M is the Mach number,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r=(1-f^{2})$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

recovery factor,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which equals unity if the air in thermal contact with the sensor is slowed
 to rest.
 The Mach number of related directly to the measured values of static pressure
 (p) and dynamic pressure (p+
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

) according to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
M^{2}=\frac{2C_{v}}{R}\left[\left\{ \frac{p+\Delta p}{p}\right\} ^{\frac{R}{C_{p}}}-1\right].\label{eq:MachNo}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The measurements influencing the final result Ta are then Ts, p, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta p$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, the recovery factor must be determined for use in (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Ts"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specific sensor discussed here is a commercial Rosemount 102E2AL sensor
 as operated on the (formerly) NCAR King Air, N312D.
 This sensor uses a platinum resistance wire that is 25 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu m$
\end_inset

 in diameter and 28 cm in length.
 The wire is wound around a supporting strut and exposed to the airstream
 in a housing that is intended to provide some separation of cloud water
 (although there is evidence that the wire still becomes wet in cloud).
 Figure XXX shows a block diagram of the system used to record the data
 and calculate Ta.
 A Rosemount 510BH signal amplifier places a small current through the sensing
 wire and measures the resistance from the voltage drop across that wire.
 It amplifies this signal and converts it to a 0-5V range.
 This output signal is then sampled by the airborne data acquisition system
 which converts the voltage to a digital number between 0 and 
\begin_inset Formula $2^{14}-1$
\end_inset

 for recording.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Calibration and data handling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usual calibration procedure for the probe is diagrammed in Fig.
 XX2 and was as follows.
 Annually, the sensor was calibrated over its temperature range in a stirred
 bath (Haake Model FK) of silicon oil where it was placed beside a reference
 grade thermometer (MINCO Model S7929) maintained at NCAR.
 [step 1] During this calibration, the 102 sensor resistance was measured
 by a Leeds and Northrup Model 4737-A20 guarded Wheatstone bridge, while
 the reference standard resistance was measured by a Guildine Model 9577
 precision digital multimeter with four-wire connections.
 The NCAR MINCO standard was periodically calibrated against a standard
 maintained at the MINCO factory [step 2], and the factory periodically
 calibrated their sensor in a calibration traceable to an NBS standard [step
 3].
 This chain of calibration served to determine the resistance of the sensor
 as a function of temperature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another calibration chain was used to calibrate the measurement of resistance.
 In this chain, a resistance box (Electro scientific DEKABOX, model DB62)
 was connected to the measurement port where the sensor was normally attached,
 and the resistance measuring system was calibrated against that resistance
 box.
 [step 4] The resistance box was periodically calibrated at the factory
 [step 5] against a factory standard that was NBS traceable [step 6].
 The results from step 4 were used to determine fit coefficients {a, b,
 c} in the formula,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
T_{s}=a+bx+cx^{2}\label{eq:Tfit}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 was the digital output from the data system (cf.
 Fig.
 XX2).
 Normally, five points spanning the full range used in research (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm40^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

) were used to determine the coefficients.
 Then (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Tfit"

\end_inset

) was used to convert measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to total temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 Then (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:Ta"

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:MachNo"

\end_inset

) were used, with measurements of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and (
\begin_inset Formula $p+\Delta p)$
\end_inset

, to derive the measurement of ambient temperature 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 The correction for the difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a}$
\end_inset

 amounted to about 
\begin_inset Formula $3-4{}^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 at typical King Air flight speeds.
 This correction will be discussed further in connection with the data analysis
 uncertainties.

\emph on
1.1 Bath Uniformity.

\emph default
 The sensor is calibrated at NCAR by placing it in a constant-temperature
 bath along with the MINCO sensor that serves as the NCAR working standard.
 The bath contains a stirred fluid and is stabilized at a set temperature
 before readings are made.
 Measurements in different parts of the bath support the indicated limits
 of 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 for both random fluctuations and for gradients (which would introduce a
 bias).
 Both are thought to be generous upper limits to the actual variations in
 the stirred bath, which is capable of maintaining temperature stable in
 the bath to 0.03
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 At this time, these estimates are not supported by time-series measurements
 as would be needed for a true Type-A uncertainty limit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
1.2 Self-heating of the sensor.

\emph default
 Wneh the sensor is calibrated, a small current is sent through the resistance
 wire and the assocaited voltage drop is measured to measure the resistance.
 This causes some Joule heating of the wire, but in the bath this heating
 is countered by conduction away from the wire.
 In the stirred bath, the temperature erroors are negligible, and would
 be even without stirring.
 The excitation current is only 1 ma while the resistance of the wire is
 ____, so it is possible to support by calculation of thermal conduction
 that the temperature rise is negligible.

1.3 Stability and repeatability of the standard.
 The m,anufacturer quotes a repeatability of 0.005
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 and a stability of 0.005
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

/yr.
 We have assumed these to be 1-standard-deviation values, although they
 are more likely 95%-confidence-limit values.
 Calibrations at the factory also support this accuracy because they differ
 less than this from year to year.
 We expect this error source to be minor in comparison to others affecting
 the final result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
1.4.
 Accuracy of the Wheatstone bridge.

\emph default
 The manufacturer claims an accuracy of 0.0005
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\pm$
\end_inset

0.01%, and a resolution of 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 Repeated calibrations of this unit support this claimed accuracy.
 In terms of temperature, the uncertainty introduced is about 0.025
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 This is tabulated as a bias even though it could enter as a random error
 in repeated calibrations because, once calibrated, any error then enters
 as a bias until the next calibration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
1.5 Lead resistance.

\emph default
 During calibration, four-wire or guarded connections are used, such that
 different wires supply the current and measure the voltage drop.
 The voltage drop in the wires supplying the current thus have no effect
 on the measurement.
 The typical excitation current is about 1 ma and the resistance about 100
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 If there is 0.01 ma in the sensing circuit and the sensing wires have a
 resistance of 0.4
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, an error in the calibration of about 0.005
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 would arise.
 This is listed as a bias in the calibration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
2.1 Repeatability of the standard.

\emph default
 The manufacturer claims a repeatability of <0.005
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 for the standard, and that is supported by repeated measurements during
 use.
 This is listed as a contribution to random error contribution because it
 refers to variations among repeated measurements; the bias is discussed
 next.
 (However, all uncertainty in the calibration eventually enters as a bias
 when measurements are made because the time between calibrations is long
 compared to the periods over which measurements are usually compared and
 combined in studies.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
2.2 Stability of the standard.

\emph default
 The manufacturer also claims that the working standard should be stable
 to 0.005
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 However, that has not been the case for repeated calibrations of the standard,
 which have differed by as much as 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 Because of this history, which may be caused either by the unit itself
 or some aspect of our treatment and use of it, we have used the consistency-of-
measurements to estimate that the bias resulting from drift during the time
 between calibration and use may be as much as 0.03
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 (standard uncertainty).
 This is a type-A uncertainty, evaluated from only a few comparisons, so
 the degrees-of-freedom associated with this elemental uncertainty is only
 about 5.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
2.3 Self-heating of the standard.

\emph default
 The standard is calibrated and used under the same conditions (i.e., same
 current through the sensor and same immersion in a stirred bath), so errors
 caused by self-heating are removed during calibration.
 The high thermal conductivity of the fluid keeps variations in the stirred
 bath on the order of 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 or less, so the error introduced by self-heating of the standard is thought
 to be negligible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
3.1 Resolution of the standard.

\emph default
 The calibration of the standard as supplied by the factory is quoted with
 a resolution of 0.001
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

, so this is used as a standard uncertainty for the error introduced by
 this rounding.

status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A better estimate would be 0.001/
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{12}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This is a type-A error and is listed as a random-error uncertainty, but
 it becomes a bias when the standard is used for calibration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
3.2 Factory calibration of the standard.

\emph default
 Other aspects of the factory calibration of the standard are assumed to
 introduce negligible uncertainty in comparison to other sources of uncertainty
 that arise during calibration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
4.1 Resistance box accuracy.

\emph default
 The uncertainty of the resistance-box values are listed by the manufacturer
 as being 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega,$
\end_inset

which corresponds to a temperature uncertainty of about 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 The manufacturer calls this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long-term
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 accuracy, so we have interpreted this as a 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

limit and have listed the associated standard uncertainty as 0.025
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 The resolution of 0.01
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

introduces a random error with standard deviation of about 0.003
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega,$
\end_inset

or a standard uncertainty in temperature of 0.015
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, the resistance box has a quoted temperature sensitivity of
 15 ppm/
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

, or about 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 per 10
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 change in the box temperature.
 The conditions under which the box is usually used are consistent to about
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

, so this effect is small in comparison to the quoted bias uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
4.2.
 Lead resistance differences.

\emph default
 Although precautions are taken to minimize lead resistance effects, connection
 of the resistance box to the sebnsing port on the aircraft involves attachment
 of leads that differ from those used during calibration.
 This error contribution is poorly known, but the estimate in the table
 is based on an uncertainty of 0.004
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

in this connection and a similar possible variation during calibration.
 This is negligible in comparison to other error sources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
4.3 Data system characteristics.

\emph default
 The data system characteristics have been discussed in the ADS hardware
 manual.
 The uncertainties quoted there are 0.012% (0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

) for bias and 0.001% (0.01
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

) for random-error uncertainty.
 These are quoted as 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

limits, so half of these values have been entered into the table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
4.4 Random error, drift, and temperature sensitivity of the 510BH amplifier.

\emph default
 See items 7.x and 7.xx for discussion of the uncertainty limits applicable
 to the signal-conditioner and amplifier.
 When calibrations are performed, the temperature, pressure, outside wind,
 and power-line conditions may vary from time to time.
 However, except as accounted for in 4.1 and 4.3 above, it is our judgment
 that those variations have negligible effect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
4.5 Quadratic representation.

\emph default
 This is a data-analysis contribution to the error in calibration.
 The calibration is performed by using five resistance values spanning the
 range recorded by the data system.
 A quadratic expression is then fitted to the five points.
 The accuracy of this procedure can be deduced from the RMS uncertainty
 remaining between the fitted curve and the original data points, which
 is typically about 0.02
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 This may arise from the natural variations in the calibration points (as
 would be consistent with other estimates of uncertainty) or to inadequacy
 of the quadratic formula to represent the true function relationship.
 The latter would distort the values used from the true curve and introduce
 a bias.
 Examination of the data from calibrations indicates that the departures
 from quadratic form do not appear to be systematic, but rather are random
 and of a magnitude consistent with other error sources.
 We therefore conclude that negligible error arises from this representation,
 and so the table does not show standard uncertainties for this source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
5,6.
 Calibration of the resistance box.

\emph default
 This calibration introduces much less uncertainty than do other parts of
 the calibration, in our judgment, so no standard uncertainty values are
 entered in the table for this source.
 The consistency of repeated calibrations supports this claim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
7.1 Self-heating of the sensor.

\emph default
 The sensor is subjected to a current of about 1 ma during operation, and
 this generates a power of about 10
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$^-4$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Watts.
 This will result in heating of the wire to a temperature above the ambient
 sufficient to produce heat conduction away from the wire of this amount.
 That is,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q=\pi Nu\lambda(T_{w}-T_{a})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the heat produced, 
\emph on
Nu
\emph default
 is the Nusselt number, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

is the thermal conductivity of air, and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{w}$
\end_inset

 is the temperature of the sensing wire.
 Lenschow and Pennell (1974) estimate 
\emph on
Nu
\emph default
=
\begin_inset Formula $0.48Re^{0.51}$
\end_inset

 where 
\emph on
Re
\emph default
 is the Reynolds Number (dfV
\begin_inset Formula $\rho/\nu,$
\end_inset

 where d is the wire diamter, f the fraction of the true airspeed V characterizi
ng flow past the wire, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

the air density, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 the kinematic viscosity).
 Substitution into this formula leads to an estimate of the self-heating
 of <0.001
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 Self-heating is thus a negligible effect on the measurement of temperature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
7.2 Long-term stability.

\emph default
 The history of calibrations supports a standard uncertainty of <0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 for the temperature sensor.
 This is evaluated as a type-A source, but the sensor changes are probably
 slow with time and not random fluctuations so this is classified as a bias-erro
r uncertainty.
 Changes occur as a result of wire string, impacts with suspended particles
 or hydrometeors, corrosion, and stresses caused by rapid temperature changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
7.3 Effects of conduction from the housing.

\emph default
 The support is designed to avoid thermal conduction to the wire, and the
 airflow is so fast through the sensor that there is negligible effect on
 its temperature.
 Calculations similar to those presented for self-heating suggest that the
 heat-balance for the wire will cause changes in wire temperature of <0.025
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 for temperature differences up to 10
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 between the wire and the housing.
 The manufacturer states that the effect is <0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 (interpreted as a 2-
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 limit).
 Temperature gradients this large seldom occur or persist, so a standard
 uncertainty of 0.025
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 has been listed in the table.
 There are contributions to both bias and random error that arise from this
 effect, because the housing temperature varies in different measurement
 cases but may systematically differ from the wire temperature also.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
7.4 Radiative effects.

\emph default
 Calculations of radiative transfer from the wire support that this term
 is negligible in comparison to heat transfer via conduction to the air.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
7.5 Variations in airflow direction.

\emph default
 There is potential sensitivity to airflow direction because the angle-of-attach
 influences the speed at which air flows through the sensor and hence may
 affect the recovery factor.
 The recovery factor is discussed in the section on data analysis, so the
 associated uncertainty is included there.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
7.6 Stresses on the sensor.

\emph default
 In addition to stresses causing long-term changes (element 7.2), varying
 stresses in flight arising from turbulence can cause changes in sensor
 performance, because a strain on the sensor will tend to increase its resistanc
e.
 Such an effect is partially compensated via determinatino of the recovery
 factor, but the recovery factor introduces a variation with true airspeed
 while stress is dependent on indicated airspeed of Mach number so the functiona
l relationship does not remove this effect entirely.
 The entry in the table reflects the small strain and low sensitivity to
 strain of the resistance wire, but this is not well determined at present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
8.1 Random error and drift of the 510BH.

\emph default
 The manufacturer quotes an uncertainty of 0.4% for the amplifier, which
 would imply an associated temperature uncertainty of 0.4
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 However, the calibrations performed at NCAR reduce this uncertainty, leaving
 only the residual uncertainty caused by random error and drift of the unit
 about its calibrated performance.
 The consistency of calibrations is the best test of the magnitude of this
 effect.
 Generally, those calibrations are consistent to about 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

, so this is a best estimate of the stability of the amplifier.
 The number of degrees of freedom is listed as about 5 because this estimate
 is bsed on a small number of calibrations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
8.2 Temperature sensitivity of the 510BH.

\emph default
 In addition to the preceding errors caused by the 510BH, the amplifier
 is operated under conditions where the temperature in the aircraft may
 change significantly more than during the calibration.
 The manufacturer quotes a sensitivity to temperature that led to the table
 estimate for the element.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
8.3 ADS system (Analog-to-digital conversion and recording).

\emph default
 The ADS system was discussed earlier in connection with the calibration.
 Its characteristics enter twice because the same system is used during
 calibration and during operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
9.1 Round-off errors.

\emph default
 All calculations are performed on computers using at least 32-bit floating-pion
t words (with 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

23-bit mantissas), so the inaccuracy caused by machine precision is insigiifncan

 conversion.
 The latter is included in item 8.3 above.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
9.3 Mach number determination.

\emph default
 The airspeed is known with an uncertainty of about 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm0.5$
\end_inset

m/s, so the Mach number is known to an accuracy of about 0.1/300
\begin_inset Formula $\simeq$
\end_inset

0.0015.
 For typical values of r
\begin_inset Formula $\simeq$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $C_{v}=(5/2)R,$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $M\simeq$
\end_inset

0.32, 
\begin_inset Formula $[1+(rRM^{2})/2C_{v}]$
\end_inset

 is 1.018, and an uncertainty in 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 of 0.0015 leads to a temperature uncertainty (for 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{a}=273$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

) of about 0.05
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 The tabulated values include 1/2 this as the standard uncertainty associated
 with both precision and bias errors.

 used in the calculations.
 Typical variations are: 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{p}=0.240+0.001$
\end_inset

cal/(gm-
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$

), and these variations lead to the table entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Combined Uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the sources of uncertainty are combined, the net calibration uncertainty
 is interpreted as characterizing bias because, once the calibration is
 determined, inaccuracies in that calibration persist until the next calibration.
 The standard uncertainty associated with calibration is 0.066
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 (obtained from Table 2.1), so this is then combined with the standard evaluation
s of uncertainty applicable to bias errors from data acquisition (0.074
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

) and from data processing (0.053
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

) to obtain a standard uncertainty of 0.11
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 applicable to bias errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combined uncertainty obtained from all sources is 0.14
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 If broken into contributions from calibration, data acquisition, and data
 processing, the contributions are respectively 0.066, 0.089, and 0.077
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

.
 The elemental sources of uncertainty having the most influence are those
 associated with long-term stability of the sensor and determination of
 the recovery factor.
 Even with better determination of the recovery factor, though, it would
 be difficult to reduce the standard uncertainty to below 0.12.
 This uncertainty analysis thus indicates that there are no easy ways to
 achieve large improvements in accuracy by addressing a single source of
 uncertainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overall standard uncertainty in temperature of 0.14
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 (or about 0.3
\begin_inset Formula $^{\circ}C$
\end_inset

 for 95% coverage) is reasonably consistent with intercomparison data and
 other experience with the sensor.

\begin_layout Standard
This section provides, for reference, specific definitions of some of the
 other terms used in the analysis of uncertainty.
 This information is included here because this terminology is sometimes
 in conflict with nonscientific usage and is not always used consistently
 even in scientific papers.

\begin_layout Standard
With many of these terms, it is necessary to distinguish between the characteris

 distribution and the estimates of those characteristics obtained from a
 specific sample from the parent population.
 For example, one may want to estimate characteristics of the parent population
 from measurements taken on only a specific subset from that population.
 A common convention, followed here, is to use Greek letters for population
 characteristics and Roman letters for sample characteristics.
 Thus, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{x}$

 will denote an average characteristic of the underlying population.

 For example, the mean in the parent population that corresponds to the
 sample mean x is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu=\langle x\rangle={\textrm{lim}}_{N\rightarrow\infty}(\overline{x}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an important distinction to be made between the standard deviation
 characterizing the random error of a measurement and the standard deviation
 characterizing a set of accurate observations and hence reflecting physical
 reality.
 The latter is often encountered in experimental research, and pertains
 to the natural variability in the parameter being measured; e.g., the temperature
 may really vary when measured over a path through the atmosphere.
 The former represents the precision with which a constant value of that
 parameter could be measured in a particular experiment.
 For example, in experiments using airborne instrumentation variance spectra
 for measured variables seldom show evidence of noise except at low levels
 that correspond to digitization noise.
 This indicates that random measurement errors seldom contribute significantly
 to the uncertainty in such a measurement.
 However, there usually is high natural variability that causes repeated
 sets of measurements in presumably identical conditions to vary significantly,
 and the standard deviations among repeated measurements of, for example,
 fluxes of water vapor are large.
 This standard deviation reflects natural variability, not the random error
 in the measurement.
 It results from the variability of particular samples about the underlying
 population mean, and that variability would still characterize measurements
 from error-free sensors.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\shape italic
median
\shape default
 is the value that divides the population into equal halves; i.e., half the

 The

most probable value

 is that observed most frequently, sometimes referred to as the 
\shape italic
mode
\shape default
 of a distribution.
 As an example, the expected distribution of time intervals between randomly

\begin_inset Formula

N(t)=N_{0}e^{-t/\tau}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N(t)$

 is the total number of events, 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is the time, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 is a time constant characterizing the process.
 For this distribution, the mean time is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 The underlying population distribution function is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Phi(x_{j})={\textrm{lim}}_{N\rightarrow\infty}P(x_{j}).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The preceding quantities can then be expressed in terms of the distribution
 function; for example, the mean is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu=\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{j}\Phi(x_{j})
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and the variance is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{2}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}(x_{j}-\mu)^{2}\Phi(x_{j})=\Bigl(\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{j}^{2}\Phi(x_{j})\Bigr)-\mu^{2}=\langle x^{2}\rangle-\mu^{2}.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The extensions to continuous distribution functions are these: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{j}P(x_{j})\rightarrow\int P(x)dx
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mu=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x\Phi(x)dx
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma^{2}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^{2}\Phi(x)dx.
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Similarly, the expectation value for any function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 of measurable characteristics 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\langle f(x)\rangle=\int f(x)\Phi(x)dx
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 can be a set of variables and the multidimensional integration must then
 cover all possible values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.

Other characteristics sometimes cited are the

probable error

, the magnitude of the deviation exceeded by 50% of the deviations, and
 the 
\shape italic
average deviation,
\shape default
 the expectation value for the absolute magnitude of the deviations.
 For a Gaussian distribution, the probable error, average deviation, and
 standard deviation have the ratios 0.674:0.800:1.

If the distribution in measurement errors follows a known probability distributi
on, then 
\shape italic
confidence intervals
\shape default
 determined from that distribution can be used to obtain quantitative estimates
 of probabilities associated with such errors.
 It is this relationship that establishes the often used correspondence
 between standard deviation and probability, for the Gaussian distribution.
 Specifically, measurements falling more than two standard deviations (
\begin_inset Formula $\pm2\sigma$
\end_inset

) from the true value are expected with about 0.05 probability, so 
\begin_inset Formula $2\sigma$
\end_inset

 limits correspond to approximate limits providing 95% coverage.
 Other distribution functions can be treated in the same way.
